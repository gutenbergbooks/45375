<h4><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>


<p>To the first volume of his remarkable series of autobiographical
novels, August Strindberg gave the name of "The Bondwoman's
Son." The allusion was twofold&mdash;to his birth and to the position
which fate, in his own eyes, seemed to have assigned him both as
man and artist.</p>

<p>If we pass on to the third part of his big trilogy, "To
Damascus," also an autobiographical work, but written nearly
twenty years later, we find <i>The Stranger</i>, who is none but the
author, saying: "I was the Bondwoman's Son, concerning whom it
was writ&mdash;Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of
the bondwoman shall not be heir with the free woman's son.'"</p>

<p>And <i>The Lady</i>, back of whom we glimpse Strindberg's second
wife, replies: "Do you know why Ishmael was cast out? It is to
be read a little further back&mdash;because he was a scoffer! And
then it is also said: 'He will be a wild man; his hand will be
against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he
shall dwell in opposition to all his brethren.'"</p>

<p>These quotations should be read in conjunction with still
another, taken from Strindberg's latest play, "The Great
Highway," which, while being a sort of symbolical summary of his
life experience, yet pierces the magic circle of self-concern
within which too often he has remained a captive. There <i>The
Hermit</i> asks: "You do not love your fellow-men?" And Strindberg,
masquerading as <i>The Hunter</i>, cries in answer: "Yes, far too
much, and fear them for that reason, too."</p>

<p>August Strindberg was born at Stockholm, Sweden, on January
22, 1849. His father was a small tradesman, who had lost his
business just before August was born, but who had the energy and
ability to start all over again as a steam-ship agent, making a
decided success of his second venture. The success, however, was
slow in coming, and the boy's earliest years were spent in the
worst kind of poverty&mdash;that poverty which has to keep up outward
appearances.</p>

<p>The mother had been a barmaid in one of the numerous inns
forming one of the Swedish capital's most characteristic
features. There the elder Strindberg had met her and fallen
deeply in love with her. August was their third child, born a
couple of months after their relationship had become legalized
in spite of bitter opposition from the husband's family. Other
children followed, many of them dying early, so that August
could write in later years that one of his first concrete
recollections was of the black-jacketed candy which used to be
passed around at every Swedish funeral.</p>

<p>Though the parents were always tired, and though the little
home was hopelessly overcrowded&mdash;ten persons living in three
rooms&mdash;yet the family life was not without its happiness. Only
August seemed to stand apart from the rest, having nothing in
common with his parents or with the other children. In fact, a
sort of warfare seems to have been raging incessantly between
him and his elder brothers. Thus a character naturally timid and
reserved had those traits developed to a point where its whole
existence seemed in danger of being warped.</p>

<p>At school he was not much happier, and as a rule he regarded
the tasks set him there as so much useless drudgery. Always and
everywhere he seemed in fear of having his personality violated,
until at last that apprehension, years later, took on a form
so morbid that it all but carried him across the limits of
rationality. With this suspiciousness of his environment went,
however, a keen desire to question and to understand. He has
said of himself that the predominant traits of his character
have been "doubt and sensitiveness to pressure." In these two
traits much of his art will, indeed, find its explanation.</p>

<p>At the age of thirteen he lost his mother, and less than a year
later his father remarried&mdash;choosing for his second wife the
former housekeeper. That occurrence made the boy's isolation at
home complete. During the years that followed he threw himself
with his usual passionate surrender into religious broodings and
practices. This mood lasted until he left for the university
at Upsala. He was then eighteen. During his first term at the
university he was so poor that he could buy no books. Worse
even&mdash;he could not buy the wood needed to heat the bare garret
where he lived.</p>

<p>Returning to Stockholm, he tried to teach in one of the public
schools&mdash;the very school which he had attended during the
unhappiest part of his childhood. From that time dates the theme
of eternal repetition, of forced return to past experiences,
which recurs constantly in his works. Another recurring theme is
that of unjust punishment, and it has also come out of his own
life&mdash;from an occasion when, as a boy of eight, he was suspected
of having drunk some wine that was missing, and when, in spite
of his indignant protests, he was held guilty and finally
compelled to acknowledge himself so in order to escape further
punishment.</p>

<p>But while still teaching school, he made certain acquaintances
that set his mind groping for some sort of literary expression.
He tried time and again to write verse, only to fail&mdash;until
one day, in a sort of trance, he found himself shaping words
into measured lines, and it suddenly dawned on him that he had
accomplished the feat held beyond him. From the first the stage
drew him, and his initial work was a little comedy, concerning
which nothing is known now. Then he wrote another one-act play
with the Danish sculptor Thorvaldsen for central figure, and
this was accepted by the Royal Theatre and actually played
with some success. Finally he produced a brief historical play
in prose, "The Outlaw," which was spurned by the critics and
the public, but which brought him the personal good-will and
financial support of King Charles XV.</p>

<p>Thus favoured, he returned to the university with the thought
of taking a degree. Instead he read everything not required in
the courses, quarrelled with every professor to whom he had to
submit himself for examination, and spent the major part of his
time with a set of youngsters whose sole ambition was to make
literature. Of that coterie, Strindberg was the only one to
reach the goal which all dreamt of. On the sudden death of the
king, when his little stipend ceased, he went up to the capital
again, bent on staying away for ever from the university.</p>

<p>During the next couple of years, he studied medicine for a
while, tried himself as an actor, conducted a trade journal, and
failed rather than succeeded to make a living as a hack writer
for various obscure newspapers. All this life he has pictured
with biting humour in his first big novel, "The Red Room."
At last, when he was twenty-three and had withdrawn in sheer
desperation to one of the little islands between Stockholm and
the open sea, he conceived and completed a five-act historical
play, named "Master Olof," after Arch-bishop Olaus Petri, the
Luther of Sweden.</p>

<p>The three main figures of that play, <i>Master Olof, King
Gustavus Vasa</i>, and <i>Gert the Printer</i>, were designed by the
author to represent three phases of his own character. The
<i>King</i> was the opportunist, <i>Olof</i> the idealist, and <i>Gert</i> the
"impossibilist." The title first chosen for the play was "The
Renegade." It was suggested by the cry with which <i>Gert</i> greets
the surrender of <i>Olof</i> in the final scene.</p>

<p>The indifference shown that first big work came near turning
Strindberg away from a literary career for ever. It took him
several years to recover from the shock of disappointment&mdash;a
shock the more severe because he felt so uncertain of his own
gifts. But those years of seeming inactivity were not lost. He
had obtained a position in the Royal Library, which gave him a
living and free access to all the books he wanted. At first he
sought forgetfulness in the most exotic studies, such as the
Chinese language. The honours of the savant tempted him, and he
wrote a monograph which was accepted by the French Institute.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, he was drawn back to his own time. And there
was hardly a field of human thought to which he did not give
some attention. Already as a student at Upsala, his conception
of life had been largely determined by the study of the Danish
individualistic philosopher Kierkegaard, the English determinist
Buckle, and the German pessimist Eduard von Hartmann. Among
novelists, Hugo and Dickens were his favourites. They together
with the brothers de Goncourt, and not Zola, helped principally
to shape his artistic form until he was strong enough to stand
wholly on his own feet.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-six he met the woman who was to play the
double part of muse and fate to him. She was already married.
In the end she obtained a divorce and became Strindberg's wife.
To begin with they were very happy, and under the stimulus of
this unfamiliar feeling Strindberg began once more to write&mdash;but
now in a manner such that recognition could no longer be denied
him. The novel already mentioned was his first popular success.
It drew bitter attacks from the conservative elements, but the
flavour of real life pervading it conquered all opposition.
To this day that first work of social criticism has not been
forgiven Strindberg by the official guardians of Swedish
literature.</p>

<p>After a while Strindberg threw himself with passion into the
study of Swedish history. One of the results was a daring work
named "The Swedish People," which is still, next to the Bible,
the most read book among the Swedes in this country. He wrote
also a series of short stories on historical themes which
combined artistic value with a truly remarkable insight into the
life of by-gone days. This series was named "Swedish Events and
Adventures." About the same time he administered some scathing
strictures on social and political conditions in a volume of
satirical essays entitled "The New Kingdom."</p>

<p>His plays from this period include "The Secret of the Guild" and
"Sir Bengt's Lady," both historical dramas of romantic nature.
To these must be added his first fairy play, "The Wanderings
of Lucky-Per," concerning which he declared recently that it
was meant for children only and must not be counted among his
more serious efforts. But this play has from the start been a
great favourite with the public, combining in its rapidly moving
scenes something of a modern "Everyman" and not a little of a
Swedish "Peer Gynt."</p>

<p>After he had resigned from the Royal Library and retired to
Switzerland for the purpose of devoting all his time to writing,
he produced the volume of short stories, "Marriage," which led
him up to the first turning point in his artistic career. It
dealt with modern marital conditions in a manner meant to reveal
the economic reefs on which so many unions are wrecked. His
attitude toward women had already become critical in that work,
but it was not yet hostile.</p>

<p>The book was confiscated. Criminal proceedings were brought
against its publisher. The charge was that it spoke offensively
of rites held sacred by the established religion of Sweden.
Everybody knew that this was a mere pretext, and that the true
grievance against the book lay in its outspoken utterances on
questions of sex morality. Urged by friends, Strindberg hastened
home and succeeded in assuming the part of defendant in place of
the publisher. The jury freed him, and the youth of the country
proclaimed him their leader and spokesman.</p>

<p>But the impression left on Strindberg's mind by that episode was
very serious and distinctly unfavourable. As in his childhood,
when he found himself disbelieved though telling the truth, so
he felt now more keenly than anything else the questioning of
his motives, which he knew to be pure. And the leaders of the
feminist movement, then particularly strong in Sweden, turned
against him with a bitterness not surpassed by that which
Ibsen had to face from directly opposite quarters after the
publication of "A Doll's House." Add finally that his marriage,
which had begun so auspiciously, was rapidly changing into
torture for both parties concerned in it.</p>

<p>Yet his growing embitterment did not make itself felt at once.
In 1885 he published four short stories meant to em-body the
onward trend of the modern spirit and the actual materialisation
of some of its fondest dreams. Collectively he named those
stories "Real Utopias," and they went far toward winning him a
reputation in Germany, where he was then living.</p>

<p>But with the appearance of the second part of "Marriage" in
1886, it was plain that a change had come over him. Its eighteen
stories constituted an unmistakable protest against everything
for which the feminist movement stood. The efforts of Ibsen and
Björnson to abolish the so-called "double code of morality"&mdash;one
for men and another one for women were openly challenged on the
ground that different results made male and female "immorality"
two widely different things. Right here it should be pointed
out, however, that Strindberg always, and especially in his
later years, has demanded as high a measure of moral purity from
men as from women&mdash;the real distinction between him and the two
great Norwegians lying in the motives on which he based that
demand.</p>

<p>The second part of "Marriage" shows a change not only in spirit
but in form, and this change becomes more accentuated in every
work published during the next few years. Until then Strindberg
had shown strong evidence of the Romantic origin of his art.
From now on, and until the ending of the great mental crisis in
the later nineties, he must be classed as an ultra-naturalist,
with strong materialistic and sceptical leanings. At the same
time he becomes more and more individualistic in his social
outlook, spurning the mass which, as he then felt, had spurned
him. And after a while the works of Nietzsche came to complete
what his personal experience had begun. His attitude toward
woman, as finally developed during this period, may be summed up
in an allegation not only of moral and mental but of biological
inferiority. And though during his later life he has retracted
much and softened more of what he said in those years of rampant
masculine rebellion, he continues to this day to regard women as
an intermediary biological form, standing between the man and
the child.</p>

<p>With the publication, in 1887, of "The Father," a modern
three-act tragedy, Strindberg reached a double climax. That work
has been hailed as one of his greatest, if not the greatest,
as far as technical perfection is concerned. At the same time
it presents that duel of the sexes&mdash;which to him had taken the
place of love&mdash;in its most startling and hideous aspects. The
gloom of the play is almost unsurpassed. The ingeniousness of
its plot may well be called infernal. By throwing doubt on her
husband's rights as father of the child held to be theirs in
common, the woman in the play manages to undermine the reason of
a strong and well-balanced man until he becomes transformed into
a raving maniac.</p>

<p>"The Comrades," a modern four-act comedy, portrays the marriage
of two artists and shows the woman as a mental parasite, drawing
both her inspiration and her skill from the husband, whom she
tries to shake off when she thinks him no longer needed for her
success. Then came the play of his which is perhaps the most
widely known&mdash;I mean the realistic drama which, for want of a
better English equivalent, must be named here "Miss Juliet." It
embodied some startling experiments in form and has undoubtedly
exercised a distinct influence on the subsequent development
of dramatic technique. On the surface it appears to offer
little more than another version of the sex duel, but back of
the conflict between man and woman we discover another one,
less deep-going perhaps, but rendered more acute by existing
conditions. It is the conflict between the upper and partly
outlived elements of society and its still unrefined, but
vitally unimpaired, strata. And it is the stronger vitality,
here represented by the man, which carries the day.</p>

<p>The rest of Strindberg's dramatic productions during this
middle, naturalistic period, lasting from 1885 to 1894, included
eight more one-act plays, several of which rank very high, and
another fairy play, "The Keys to Heaven," which probably marks
his nearest approach to a purely negative conception of life.</p>

<p>Paralleling the plays, we find a series of novels and short
stories dealing with the people on those islands where
Strindberg fifteen years earlier had written his "Master
Olof." Two things make these works remarkable: first, the rare
understanding shown in them of the life led by the tough race
that exists, so to speak, between land and sea; and secondly,
their genuine humour, which at times, as in the little story
named "The Tailor Has a Dance," rises into almost epic
expression. The last of these novels, "At the Edge of the Sea,"
embodies Strindberg's farthest advance into Nietzschean dreams
of supermanhood. But led by his incorruptible logic, he is
forced to reduce those dreams to the absurdity which they are
sure to involve whenever the superman feels himself standing
apart from ordinary humanity.</p>

<p>Finally he wrote, during the earlier part of this marvellously
prolific period, five autobiographical novels. One of these was
not published until years later. Three others were collectively
known as "The Bondwoman's Son," and carried his revelations up
to the time of his marriage. The first volume in the series is
especially noteworthy because of its searching and sympathetic
study of child psychology. But all the novels in this series
are of high value because of the sharp light they throw on
social conditions. Strindberg's power as an acute and accurate
observer has never been questioned, and it has rarely been more
strikingly evidenced than in his autobiographical writings. A
place by itself, though belonging to the same series, is held by
"A Fool's Confession," wherein Strindberg laid bare the tragedy
of his first marriage. It is the book that has exposed him to
more serious criticism than any other. He wrote it in French and
consented to its publication only as a last means of escaping
unendurable financial straits. Against his vain protests,
unauthorised translations were brought out in German and Swedish.</p>

<p>The dissolution of his marriage occurred in 1891. The
circumstances surrounding that break were extremely painful
to Strindberg. Both the facts of the legal procedure and
the feelings it evoked within himself have been almost
photographically portrayed in the one-act play, "The Link,"
which forms part of this volume. The "link" which binds man and
woman together even when their love is gone and the law has
severed all external ties is the child&mdash;and it is always for the
offspring that Strindberg reserves his tenderest feelings and
greatest concern.</p>

<p>After the divorce Strindberg left for Germany, where his works
in the meantime had been making steady headway. A couple of
years later he was taken up in France, and there was a time
during the first half of the nineties, when he had plays running
simultaneously at half a dozen Parisian theatres. While at
Berlin, he met a young woman writer of Austrian birth who soon
after became his second wife. Their marriage lasted only a few
years, and while it was not as unhappy as the first one, it
helped to bring on the mental crisis for which Strindberg had
been heading ever since the prosecution of "Marriage," in 1884.</p>

<p>He ceased entirely to write and plunged instead into scientific
speculation and experimentation. Chemistry was the subject
that had the greatest fascination for him, and his dream was
to prove the transmutability of the elements. In the course
of a prolonged stay at Paris, where he shunned everybody and
risked both health and life in his improvised laboratory,
his mental state became more and more abnormal, without ever
reaching a point where he ceased to realise just what was going
on within himself. He began to have psychic experiences of a
character that to him appeared distinctly supernatural. At the
same time he was led by the reading of Balzac to the discovery
of Swedenborg. By quick degrees, though not without much
mental suffering, he rejected all that until then had to him
represented life's highest truths. From being a materialistic
sceptic, he became a believing mystic, to whom this world seemed
a mere transitory state of punishment, a "hell" created by his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>The crisis took him in the end to a private sanitarium kept by
an old friend in the southern part of Sweden, but it would be
far from safe to assume that he ever reached a state of actual
insanity. His return to health began in 1896 and was completed
in a year. In 1897 he resumed his work of artistic creation once
more, and with a new spirit that startled those who had held him
lost for ever. First of all a flood of personal experiences and
impressions needed expression. This he accomplished by his two
autobiographical novels, "Inferno" and "Legends," the former
of which must be counted one of the most remarkable studies in
abnormal psychology in the world's literature. Next came "The
Link" and another one-act play. In 1898 he produced the first
two parts of "To Damascus," a play that&mdash;in strikingly original
form, and with a depth of thought and feeling not before
achieved&mdash;embodied his own soul's long pilgrimage in search of
internal and external harmony. The last part of the trilogy was
not added until 1904.</p>

<p>Then followed ten years of production so amazing that it
surpassed his previous high-water mark during the middle
eighties, both in quality and quantity. Once for all the mood
and mode of his creation had been settled. He was still a
realist in so far as faithfulness to life was concerned, but
the reality for which he had now begun to strive was spiritual
rather than material. He can, during this final period, only be
classed as a symbolist, but of the kind typified by Ibsen in the
series of masterpieces beginning with "Rosmersholm" and ending
with "Little Eyolf."</p>

<p>More and more as he pushes on from one height to another, he
manages to fuse the two offices of artist and moralist without
injury to either of them. His view of life is still pessimistic,
but back of man's earthly disappointments and humiliations and
sufferings he glimpses a higher existence to which this one
serves merely as a preparation. Everything that happens to
himself and to others seems to reveal the persistent influence
of secret powers, pulling and pushing, rewarding and punishing,
but always urging and leading man to some goal not yet bared to
his conscious vision. Resignation, humility, kindness become
the main virtues of human existence. And the greatest tragedy
of that existence he sees in man's&mdash;that is, his own&mdash;failure
to make all his actions conform to those ideals. Thus, in the
closing line of his last play, "The Great Highway," he pleads
for mercy as one who has suffered more than most "from the
inability to be that which we will to be."</p>

<p>Among the earliest results of his autumnal renascence was a
five-act historical drama named "Gustavus Vasa." It proved the
first of a dozen big plays dealing with the main events in his
country's history from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century.
As a rule they were built about a monarch whose reign marked
some national crisis. Five stand out above the rest in artistic
value: "Gustavus Vasa," "Erie XIV," "Gustavus Adolphus,"
"Charles XII," and "The Last Knight." At once intensely
national and broadly human in their spirit, these plays won for
Strindberg a higher place in his countrymen's hearts than he
had ever before held&mdash;though notes of discord were not missing
on account of the freedom with which he exposed and demolished
false idols and outlived national ideals. As they stand to-day,
those dramas have in them so much of universal appeal that I
feel sure they must sooner or later win the same attention in
the English-speaking countries that they have already received
in Germany.</p>

<p>While thus recalling the past to new life, he was also busy
with another group of plays embodying what practically amounts
to a new dramatic form. The literary tendency underlying them
might be defined as realistic symbolism or impressionistic
mysticism&mdash;you can take your choice! The characters in those
plays are men and women very much belonging to our own day. They
speak as you or I might do. And yet there is in them and about
them a significance surpassing not only that of the ordinary
individual, but also that of ordinary poetical portrayals of
such individuals.</p>

<p>"There Are Crimes and Crimes," "Christmas," "Easter," and
"Midsummer" are the principal plays belonging to this group.
With them must be classed the trio of fairy or "dream" plays
written under the acknowledged influence of Maeterlinck. In the
first of these, the charming dramatic legend named "Swanwhite,"
the impetus received from the Belgian makes itself clearly felt.
In the last of them, "The Dream Play," Strindberg has worked out
a form that is wholly new and wholly his own. As the play in
question forms part of this volume, I shall not need to speak of
it here in the manner it would otherwise deserve.</p>

<p>Related to the group just described, and yet not confinable
within it, stands the double drama, "The Dance of Death," which
also appears in this volume. Numerous critics have declared
it Strindberg's greatest play, and there is much in the work
to warrant such a judgment. Its construction is masterly. Its
characters are almost shockingly real. And yet the play as a
whole is saturated with that sense of larger relationships which
we are wont to dispose of by calling it "mysticism." Like all
of Strindberg's work belonging to this period, it constitutes
a huge piece of symbolism&mdash;but the subject of its symbolical
interpretation seems to be nothing less than the sum of human
interrelationships.</p>

<p>During the last three or four years of the decade we are now
dealing with, Strindberg was very much interested in the project
of establishing a theatre at Stockholm, where nothing but his
own productions were to be staged. The plan was actually carried
out and a building arranged that held only about two hundred
people. It was called the Intimate Theatre. There Strindberg
made some highly interesting experiments in the simplification
and standardising of scenery, until at last some of his plays
were given with no other accessories than draperies. The effects
thus obtained proved unexpectedly successful. For this stage
Strindberg wrote five dramas which he defined as "chamber
plays." In form they harked back to "Miss Juliet," and they were
meant to be played without interruptions. But in spirit they
were marked by the same blend of mysticism and realism that
forms such a striking feature of "The Dream Play," for instance.
Add to these another fairy play, "The Slippers of Abu Casem,"
and a final autobiographical drama named "The Great Highway,"
and we get a total of twenty-nine dramatic works in ten years.
For more critical treatment of Strindberg's art I would refer
the reader to my articles in <i>The Forum</i> of February and March,
1912.</p>

<p>But at the same time Strindberg's pen was no less active in
other fields. There are two more autobiographical volumes, two
novels displaying vast social canvasses, four collections of
short stories, and one collection of poems; also three bulky
volumes named collectively "The Blue Books" and containing the
most wonderful medley of scientific speculations, philosophical
pronouncements, personal polemics, and aphoristic embodiments
of the author's rich store of wisdom; and finally a score of
pamphlets&mdash;analytical studies of Shakespeare plays, instructions
to the members of the Intimate Theatre, satirical studies of
contemporary social and literary conditions, propositions for
a more complete democratisation of the government, and so
on almost endlessly. And notwithstanding much supercilious
criticism as well as some warranted regrets for the tone at
times employed in these works, it is pretty generally admitted
that Strindberg never has approached any topic without saying
something worth while about it.</p>

<p>Outwardly Strindberg's life has been very quiet since he
returned to his native country in 1897. A third marriage,
contracted in 1901 and dissolved three years later, served only
to reconcile him once for all to the solitude that has always
surrounded him more or less, even in the midst of admiring
or condemning multitudes. He is now sixty-three years old,
and the last news indicates that, at last, his iron health is
failing him. In the sheltered nook which he has established
for himself at Stockholm, he busies himself with philological
studies, interrupted mainly by visits from his children, of
which there are five from the three marriages. Two of these&mdash;his
eldest daughter, who is now happily married, and the youngest,
a vivacious lass of nine to whom "The Slippers of Abu Casem"
was dedicated&mdash;are in the habit of calling daily. Flowers and
music are what he loves next to his children and his work. From
that corner where he hears nothing but echoes of the storms
that are still raging at times about his public utterances, he
follows with keen eye whatever is happening in the world of
deeds as well as in the world of letters. And in the meantime
his fame is steadily spreading and growing. On the European
continent his name is constantly mentioned together with those
of Ibsen and Björnson. In the English-speaking countries it has
hitherto remained merely a name. The time has surely come for
a realisation of some of the things that name stands for, and
it is my earnest hope that this volume may help to change a
condition that reflects more on those who do not know than on
him who is not known.</p>

<p>In regard to the style of my translations, I wish to quote
some words written before the task now finished had ever been
suggested to me. They are from an article on "Slaughtering
Strindberg," which appeared in "The Drama," of August, 1911:</p>

<p>"Strindberg is the man who has raised modern Swedish to its
utmost potency of beauty and power. It may also be said, and
with equal truth, that he has made the literary language of this
country truly modern. This he has achieved not by polishing
study-born mannerisms, but by watching and developing the
living idiom that flows from the lips of men and women around
him&mdash;observed at home and in the office, on the street and in
the restaurant, while loving and dying, while chatting and
quarrelling. Never was a man more keen on catching the life
breath of his own time, and never was a man more scornful of
mere fads and fashions, born one moment and forgotten in the
next. To transplant the work of such a man may be difficult, but
it involves no impossibility, provided only that we observe his
own practical attitude toward what constitutes 'good form' and
'bad form' in a pulsing and growing language. We, on this side
of the ocean, ought to be able to read Strindberg and receive
impressions virtually identical with those received by a Swedish
reader at Stockholm. And I believe that it will be easier to
find equivalents for his clean-cut and flexible prose out of
what is called English here than out of what bears that name in
England."</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to mention that the prologue now attached
to "The Dream Play" has never before been published in any
language. It was written last year as an afterthought, and was
by the author kindly placed at my disposal in manuscript.</p>

<h5>1902</h5>



<hr class="chap" />
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">A REMINDER</p>

<p>As he did in his previous dream play,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> so in this one the
author has tried to imitate the disconnected but seemingly
logical form of the dream. Anything may happen; everything
is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. On an
insignificant background of reality, imagination designs and
embroiders novel patterns: a medley of memories, experiences,
free fancies, absurdities and improvisations.</p>

<p>The characters split, double, multiply, vanish, solidify, blur,
clarify. But one consciousness reigns above them all&mdash;that
of the dreamer; and before it there are no secrets, no
incongruities, no scruples, no laws. There is neither judgment
nor exoneration, but merely narration. And as the dream is
mostly painful, rarely pleasant, a note of melancholy and of
pity with all living things runs right through the wabbly tale.
Sleep, the liberator, plays often a dismal part, but when the
pain is at its worst, the awakening comes and reconciles the
sufferer with reality, which, however distressing it may be,
nevertheless seems happy in comparison with the torments of the
dream.</p>

<h5><i>Curtain</i>.</h5>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p><i>The background represents a forest of gigantic
hollyhocks in bloom. They are white, pink, crimson,
sulphureous, violet; and above their tops is seen
the gilded roof of a castle, the apex of which is
formed by a bud resembling a crown. At the foot of
the castle walls stand a number of straw ricks,
and around these stable litter is scattered. The
side-scenes, which remain unchanged throughout the
play, show conventionalised frescoes, suggesting
at once internal decoration, architecture, and
landscape</i>.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The castle is growing higher and higher above the
ground. Do you see how much it has grown since last year?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. [<i>To himself</i>] I have never seen this castle
before&mdash;have never heard of a castle that grew, but&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE
DAUGHTER</span>, <i>with firm conviction</i>] Yes, it has grown two yards,
but that is because they have manured it&mdash;and it you notice, it
has put out a wing on the sunny side.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Ought it not to be blooming soon, as we are
already past midsummer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. Don't you see the flower up there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, I see! [<i>Claps her hands</i>] Say, father, why
do flowers grow out of dirt?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>, [<i>Simply</i>] Because they do not feel at home in the
dirt, and so they make haste to get up into the light in order
to blossom and die.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Do you know who lives in that castle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. I have known it, but cannot remember.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I believe a prisoner is kept there&mdash;and he must be
waiting for me to set him free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. And what is he to pay for it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. One does not bargain about one's duty. Let us go
into the castle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. Yes, let us go in.</p>

<p><i>They go toward the background, which opens and slowly
disappears to either side</i>.</p>

<p><i>The stage shows now a humble, bare room, containing only a
table and a few chairs. On one of the chairs sits an officer,
dressed in a very unusual yet modern uniform. He is tilting the
chair backward and beating the table with his sabre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Goes to the officer, from whose hand she gently
takes the sabre</i>] Don't! Don't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Oh, Agnes dear, let me keep the sabre.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No, you break the table. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>.] Now
you go down to the harness-room and fix that window pane. We'll
meet later.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You are imprisoned in your own rooms&mdash;I have come
to set you free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I have been waiting for you, but I was not sure you
were willing to do it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The castle is strongly built; it has seven walls,
but&mdash;it can be done!&mdash;Do you want it, or do you not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Frankly speaking, I cannot tell&mdash;for in either
case I shall suffer pain. Every joy that life brings has to be
paid for with twice its measure of sorrow. It is hard to stay
where I am, but if I buy the sweets of freedom, then I shall
have to suffer twice as much&mdash;Agnes, I'll rather endure it as it
is, if I can only see you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What do you see in me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Beauty, which is the harmony of the universe&mdash;There
are lines of your body which are nowhere to be found, except
in the orbits of the solar system, in strings that are singing
softly, or in the vibrations of light&mdash;You are a child of
heaven&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. So are you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Why must I then keep horses, tend stable, and cart
straw?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. So that you may long to get away from here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I am longing, but it is so hard to find one's way
out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But it is a duty to seek freedom in the light.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Duty? Life has never recognised any duties toward
me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You feel yourself wronged by life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes, it has been unjust&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Now voices are heard from behind a 'partition, which
a moment later is pulled away</i>. <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span> <i>look in that direction and stop as if
paralysed in the midst of a gesture</i>.</p>

<p><i>At a table sits</i> <span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>, <i>looking very sick. In
front of her a tallow candle is burning, and every
little while she trims it with, a pair of snuffers.
The table is piled with new-made shirts, and these
she is marking with a quill and ink. To the left
stands a brown-coloured wardrobe</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. [<i>Holds out a silk mantilla toward</i> <span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span> <i>and
says gently</i>] You don't want it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. A silk mantilla for me, my dear&mdash;of what use would
that be when I am going to die shortly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. Do you believe what the doctor says?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Yes, I believe also what he says, but still more
what the voice says in here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. [<i>Sadly</i>] It is true then?&mdash;And you are thinking of
your children first and last.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. That has been my life and my reason for living&mdash;my
joy and my sorrow</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. Christine, forgive me&mdash;everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. What have I to forgive? Dearest, you forgive <i>me</i>!
We have been tormenting each other. Why? That we may not know.
We couldn't do anything else&mdash;However, here is the new linen for
the children. See that they change twice a week&mdash;Wednesdays and
Sundays&mdash;and that Louise washes them&mdash;their whole bodies&mdash;Are
you going out?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. I have to be in the Department at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Ask Alfred to come in before you go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. [<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>] Why, he is standing
right there, dear heart.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. So my eyes are failing, too&mdash;Yes, it is turning
dark. [<i>Trims the candle</i>] Come here, Alfred.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span> <i>goes out through the middle of the wall,
nodding good-bye as he leaves</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span> <i>goes over to</i> <span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Who is that girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>, [<i>Whispers</i>] It is Agnes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Oh, is that Agnes?&mdash;Do you know what they say?&mdash;That
she is a daughter of the god Indra who has asked leave to
descend to the earth in order that she may find out what the
conditions of men are&mdash;But don't say anything about it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. A child of the gods, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. [<i>Aloud</i>] My Alfred, I must soon part from you and
from the other children&mdash;But let me first speak a word to you
that bears on all the rest of your life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Sadly</i>] Speak, mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Only a word: don't quarrel with God!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. What do you mean, mother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Don't go around feeling that life has wronged you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. But when I am treated unjustly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. You are thinking of the time when you were unjustly
punished for having taken a penny that later turned up?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes, and that one wrong gave a false twist to my
whole life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Perhaps. But please take a look into that wardrobe
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Embarrassed</i>] You know, then? It is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. The Swiss Family Robinson&mdash;for which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Don't say any more!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. For which your brother was punished&mdash;and which you
had torn and hidden away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Just think that the old wardrobe is still standing
there after twenty years&mdash;We have moved so many times, and my
mother died ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Yes, and what of it? You are always asking all sorts
of questions, and in that way you spoil the better part of your
life&mdash;There is Lena, now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Thank you very much, ma'am, but I can't go to
the baptism.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. And why not, my girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span>. I have nothing to put on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. I'll let you use my mantilla here</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span>. Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't do!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Why not?&mdash;It is not likely that I'll go to any more
parties.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. And what will father say? It is a present from
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. What small minds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. [<i>Puts his head through the wall</i>] Are you going to
lend my present to the servant girl?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Don't talk that way! Can you not remember that I
was a servant girl also? Why should you offend one who has done
nothing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE FATHER</span>. Why should you offend me, your husband?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MOTHER</span>. Oh, this life! If you do anything nice, there is
always somebody who finds it nasty. If you act kindly to one, it
hurts another. Oh, this life!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They go toward the background</i>.</p>

<p><i>The background is raised and a new one revealed,
showing an old, dilapidated party-wall. In the
centre of it is a gate closing a passageway. This
opens upon a green, sunlit space, where is seen a
tremendous blue monk's-hood (aconite). To the left of
the gate sits</i> <span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. <i>Her head and shoulders
are covered by a shawl, and she is crocheting at a
bed-spread with a star-like pattern. To the right of
the gate is a billboard, which</i> <span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span> <i>is
cleaning. Beside him stands a dipnet with a green
pole. Further to the right is a door that has an
air-hole shaped like a four-leaved clover. To the
left of the gate stands a small linden tree with
coal-black trunk and a few pale-green leaves. Near it
is a small air-hole leading into a cellar.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Going to</i> <span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>] Is the spread not done
yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No, dear. Twenty-six years on such a piece of work
is not much.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And your lover never came back?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No, but it was not his fault. He had to go&mdash;poor
thing! That was thirty years ago now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>] She belonged to the ballet?
Up there in the opera-house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. She was number one&mdash;but when <i>he</i> went, it was
as if her dancing had gone with him&mdash;and so she didn't get any
more parts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Everybody complains&mdash;with their eyes, at least,
and often with words also&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. I don't complain very much&mdash;not now, since I
have a dipnet and a green cauf<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And that can make you happy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. Oh, I'm so happy, so&mdash;It was the dream of my
youth, and now it has come true. Of course, I have grown to be
fifty years&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Fifty years for a dipnet and a cauf&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. A <i>green</i> cauf&mdash;mind you, <i>green</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>] Let me have the shawl now,
and I shall sit here and watch the human children. But you must
stand behind me and tell me about everything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She takes the shawl and sits down at the gate.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. This is the last day, and the house will be closed
up for the season. This is the day when they learn whether their
contracts are to be renewed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And those that fail of engagement&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. O, Lord have mercy! I pull the shawl over my head
not to see them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Poor human creatures!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. Look, here comes one&mdash;She's not one of the chosen.
See, how she cries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE SINGER</span> <i>enters from the right; rushes through the
gate with her handkerchief to her eyes; stops for a

her head against the wall; then out quickly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Men are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. But look at this one. That's the way a happy
person looks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span> <i>enters through the passageway; dressed
in Prince Albert coat and high hat, and carrying a
bunch of roses in one hand; he is radiantly happy</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. He's going to marry Miss Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Far down on the stage, looks up and sings</i>]
Victoria!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. The young lady will be coming in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Good! The carriage is waiting, the table is set,
the wine is on ice&mdash;Oh, permit me to embrace you, ladies! [<i>He
embraces</i> <span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. <i>Sings</i>] Victoria!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">A WOMAN'S VOICE FROM ABOVE</span>. [<i>Sings</i>] I am here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Do you know me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. No, I know one woman only&mdash;Victoria. Seven years
I have come here to wait for her&mdash;at noon, when the sun touched
the chimneys, and at night, when it was growing dark. Look at
the asphalt here, and you will see the path worn by the steps
of a faithful lover. Hooray! She is mine. [<i>Sings</i>] Victoria!
[<i>There is no reply</i>] Well, she is dressing, I suppose.
[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>] There is the dipnet, I see. Everybody
belonging to the opera is crazy about dipnets&mdash;or rather about
fishes&mdash;because the fishes are dumb and cannot sing!&mdash;What is
the price of a thing like that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. It is rather expensive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Sings</i>] Victoria! [<i>Shakes the linden tree</i>]
Look, it is turning green once more. For the eighth time.
[<i>Sings</i>] Victoria!&mdash;Now she is fixing her hair. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE
DAUGHTER</span>] Look here, madam, could I not go up and get my bride?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. Nobody is allowed on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Seven years I have been coming here. Seven times
three hundred and sixty-five makes two thousand five hundred and
fifty-five. [<i>Stops and pokes at the door with the four-leaved
clover hole</i>] And I have been looking two thousand five hundred
and fifty-five times at that door without discovering where it
leads. And that clover leaf which is to let in light&mdash;for whom
is the light meant? Is there anybody within? Does anybody live
there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. I don't know. I have never seen it opened.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It looks like a pantry door which I saw once
when I was only four years old and went visiting with the maid
on a Sunday afternoon. We called at several houses&mdash;on other
maids&mdash;but I did not get beyond the kitchen anywhere, and I had
to sit between the water barrel and the salt box. I have seen
so many kitchens in my days, and the pantry was always just
outside, with small round holes bored in the door, and one big
hole like a clover leaf&mdash;But there cannot be any pantry in the
opera-house as they have no kitchen. [<i>Sings</i>] Victoria!&mdash;Tell
me, madam, could she have gone out any other way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No, there is no other way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Well, then I shall see her here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Now she must soon be coming&mdash;Madam, that blue
monk's-hood outside&mdash;I have seen it since I was a child. Is it
the same?&mdash;I remember it from a country rectory where I stopped
when I was seven years old&mdash;There are two doves, two blue doves,
under the hood&mdash;but that time a bee came flying and went into
the hood. Then I thought: now I have you! And I grabbed hold
of the flower. But the sting of the bee went through it, and I
cried&mdash;but then the rector's wife came and put damp dirt on the
sting&mdash;and we had strawberries and cream for dinner&mdash;I think it
is getting dark already. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>] Where are you
going?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span>. Home for supper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Draws his hand across his eyes</i>] Evening? At
this time?&mdash;O, please, may I go in and telephone to the Growing
Castle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What do you want there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I am going to tell the Glazier to put in double
windows, for it will soon be winter, and I am feeling horribly
cold. [<i>Goes into the gatekeeper's lodge</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who is Miss Victoria?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. His sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Right said! What she is to us and others matters
nothing to him. And what she is to him, that alone is her real
self.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>It is suddenly turning dark</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. [<i>Lights a lantern</i>] It is growing dark early
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. To the gods a year is as a minute.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. And to men a minute may be as long as a year.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Enters again, looking dusty; the roses are
withered</i>] She has not come yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. But she will come&mdash;She will come! [<i>Walks up and
down</i>] But come to think of it, perhaps I had better call off
the dinner after all&mdash;as it is late? Yes, I will do that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes back into the lodge and telephones</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>] Can I have my shawl back now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No, dear, be free a while. I shall attend to your
duties&mdash;for I want to study men and life, and see whether things
really are as bad as they say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. But it won't do to fall asleep here&mdash;never sleep
night or day&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No sleep at night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. Yes, if you are able to get it, but only with the
bell string tied around the wrist&mdash;for there are night watchmen
on the stage, and they have to be relieved every third hour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But that is torture!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. So you think, but people like us are glad enough
to get such a job, and if you only knew how envied I am&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Envied?&mdash;Envy for the tortured?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. Yes&mdash;But I can tell you what is harder than all
drudging and keeping awake nights, harder to bear than draught
and cold and dampness&mdash;it is to receive the confidences of all
the unhappy people up there&mdash;They all come to me. Why? Perhaps
they read in the wrinkles of my face some runes that are graved
by suffering and that invite confessions&mdash;In that shawl, dear,
lie hidden thirty years of my own and other people's agonies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is heavy, and it burns like nettles.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. As it is your wish, you may wear it. When it grows
too burdensome, call me, and I shall relieve you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Good-bye. What can be done by you ought not to
surpass my strength.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. We shall see!&mdash;But be kind to my poor friends, and
don't grow impatient of their complaints.</p>

long&mdash;the net turned out pretty good, but not as I had expected.</p>

expected, and the pleasure of it was not so much after all.</p>

was not. It had to be green, but not that kind of green.</p>

look as if the wall-paper itself had been soiled by every
conceivable sin? Look at these documents into which I write
tales of wrong. Look at myself&mdash;No smiling man ever comes here;
nothing is to be seen here but angry glances, snarling lips,
clenched fists&mdash;And everybody pours his anger, his envy, his
suspicions, upon me. Look&mdash;my hands are black, and no washing
will clean them. See how they are chapped and bleeding&mdash;I can
never wear my clothes more than a few days because they smell
of other people's crimes&mdash;At times I have the place fumigated
with sulphur, but it does not help. I sleep near by, and I
dream of nothing but crimes&mdash;Just now I have a murder case in
court&mdash;oh, I can stand that, but do you know what is worse than
anything else?&mdash;That is to separate married people! Then it is
as if something cried way down in the earth and up there in the
sky&mdash;as if it cried treason against the primal force, against
the source of all good, against love&mdash;And do you know, when
reams of paper have been filled with mutual accusations, and at
last a sympathetic person takes one of the two apart and asks,
with a pinch of the ear or a smile, the simple question: what
have you really got against your husband?&mdash;or your wife?&mdash;then
he, or she, stands perplexed and cannot give the cause.
Once&mdash;well, I think a lettuce salad was the principal issue;
another time it was just a word&mdash;mostly it is nothing at all.
But the tortures, the sufferings&mdash;these I have to bear&mdash;See how
I look! Do you think I could ever win a woman's love with this
countenance so like a criminal's? Do you think anybody dares to
be friendly with me, who has to collect all the debts, all the
money obligations, of the whole city?&mdash;It is a misery to be man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Men are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. They are. And what people are living on puzzles me.
They marry on an income of two thousand, when they need four
thousand. They borrow, of course&mdash;everybody borrows. In some
sort of happy-go-lucky fashion, by the skin of their teeth, they
manage to pull through&mdash;and thus it continues to the end, when
the estate is found to be bankrupt. Who pays for it at last no
one can tell.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Perhaps He who feeds the birds.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Perhaps. But if He who feeds the birds would only
pay a visit to this earth of His and see for Himself how the
poor human creatures fare&mdash;then His heart would surely fill with
compassion.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Men are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, that is the truth!&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>] What do
you want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I just wanted to ask if Miss Victoria has gone yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. No, she has not; you can be sure of it&mdash;Why are you
poking at my chest over there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I thought the door of it looked exactly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Not at all! Not at all!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>All the church bells begin to ring</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Is there going to be a funeral?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. No, it is graduation day&mdash;a number of degrees will
be conferred, and I am going to be made a Doctor of Laws.
Perhaps you would also like to be graduated and receive a laurel
wreath?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes, why not. That would be a diversion, at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Perhaps then we may begin upon this solemn function
at once&mdash;But you had better go home and change your clothes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The stage is darkened and the following changes are
made. The railing stays, but it encloses now the
chancel of a church. The billboard displays hymn
numbers. The linden hat tree becomes a candelabrum.
The Lawyer's desk is turned into the desk of the
presiding functionary, and the door with the clover
leaf leads to the vestry</i>.</p>

<p><i>The chorus of Master Singers become heralds with
staffs, and the Ballet Girls carry laurel wreaths.
The rest of the people act as spectators</i>.</p>

<p><i>The background is raised, and the new one thus
discovered represents a large church organ, with the
keyboards below and the organist's mirror above</i>.</p>

<p><i>Music is heard. At the sides stand figures
symbolising the four academic faculties: Philosophy,
Theology, Medicine, and Jurisprudence</i>.</p>

<p><i>At first the stage is empty for a few moments</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HERALDS</span> <i>enter from the right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BALLET GIRLS</span> <i>follow with laurel wreaths carried high
before them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THREE GRADUATES</span> <i>appear one after another from the
left, receive their wreaths from the</i> <span class="small-c">BALLET GIRLS</span>,
<i>and go out to the right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span> <i>steps forward to get his wreath</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="small-c">BALLET GIRLS</span> <i>turn away from him and refuse to
place the wreath on his head. Then they withdraw from
the stage</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>, <i>shocked, leans against a column. All
the others withdraw gradually until only</i> <span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>
<i>remains on the stage</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Enters, her head and shoulders covered by a
white veil</i>] Do you see, I have washed the shawl! But why are
you standing there? Did you get your wreath?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. No, I was not held worthy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why? Because you have defended the poor, put in a
good word for the wrong-doing, made the burden easier for the
guilty, obtained a respite for the condemned? Woe upon men: they
are not angels&mdash;but they are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Say nothing evil of men&mdash;for after all it is my task
to voice their side.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Leaning against the organ</i>] Why do they strike
their friends in the face?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. They know no better.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Let us enlighten them. Will you try? Together with
me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. They do not accept enlightenment&mdash;Oh, that our
plaint might reach the gods of heaven!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It shall reach the throne&mdash;[<i>Turns toward the
organ</i>] Do you know what I see in this mirror?&mdash;The world turned
the right way!&mdash;Yes indeed, for naturally we see it upside down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. How did it come to be turned the wrong way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. When the copy was taken&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You have said it! The copy&mdash;I have always had the
feeling that it was a spoiled copy. And when I began to recall
the original images, I grew dissatisfied with everything. But
men called it soreheadedness, looking at the world through the
devil's eyes, and other such things.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is certainly a crazy world! Look at the four
faculties here. The government, to which has fallen the task
of preserving society, supports all four of them. Theology,
the science of God, is constantly attacked and ridiculed by
philosophy, which declares itself to be the sum of all wisdom.
And medicine is always challenging philosophy, while refusing
entirely to count theology a science and even insisting on
calling it a mere superstition. And they belong to a common
Academic Council, which has been set to teach the young
respect&mdash;for the university. It is a bedlam. And woe unto him
who first recovers his reason!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Those who find it out first are the theologians. As
a preparatory study, they take philosophy, which teaches them
that theology is nonsense. Later they learn from theology that
philosophy is nonsense. Madmen, I should say!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And then there is jurisprudence which serves all
but the servants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Justice, which, when it wants to do right, becomes
the undoing of men. Equity, which so often turns into iniquity!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What a mess you have made of it, you man-children.
Children, indeed!&mdash;Come here, and I will give you a wreath&mdash;one
that is more becoming to you. [<i>Puts a crown of thorns on his
head</i>] And now I will play for you.</p>

<p><i>She sits down at the keyboards, but instead of organ-notes
human voices are heard</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">VOICES OF CHILDREN</span>. O Lord everlasting!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Last note sustained</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">VOICES OF WOMEN</span>. Have mercy upon us!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Last note sustained</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">VOICES OF MEN</span>. [<i>Tenors</i>] Save us for Thy mercy's sake!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Last note sustained</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">VOICES OF MEN</span>. [Basses] Spare Thy children, O Lord, and deliver
us from Thy wrath!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. Have mercy upon us! Hear us! Have pity upon the mortals!&mdash;?
O Lord eternal, why art Thou afar?&mdash;Out of the depths we call
unto Thee: Make not the burden of Thy children too heavy! Hear
us! Hear us!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The stage turns dark</i>. <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span> <i>rises and draws
close to</i> <span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. <i>By a change of light, the
organ becomes Fingal's Cave. The ground-swell of the
ocean, which can be seen rising and falling between
the columns of basalt, produces a deep harmony that
blends the music of winds and waves</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Where are we, sister?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I hear drops falling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Those are the tears that men are weeping&mdash;What
more do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. There is sighing&mdash;and whining&mdash;and wailing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Hither the plaint of the mortals has reached&mdash;and
no farther. But why this never-ending wailing? Is there then
nothing in life to rejoice at?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, what is most sweet, and what is also most
bitter&mdash;love&mdash;wife and home&mdash;the highest and the lowest!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. May I try it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. With me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. With you&mdash;You know the rocks, the
stumbling-stones. Let us avoid them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I am so poor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What does that matter if we only love each other?
And a little beauty costs nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I have dislikes which may prove your likes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. They can be adjusted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And if we tire of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Then come the children and bring with them a
diversion that remains for ever new.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You, you will take me, poor and ugly, scorned and
rejected?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes&mdash;let us unite our destinies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. So be it then!</p>

<p><i>An extremely plain room inside</i> <span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>'s
<i>office. To the right, a big double bed covered by
a canopy and curtained in. Next to it, a window. To
the left, an iron heater with cooking utensils on top
of it</i>. <span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span> <i>is pasting paper strips along the
cracks of the double windows. In the background, an
open door to the office. Through the door are visible
a number of poor clients waiting for admission</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I paste, I paste.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Pale and emaciated, sits by the stove</i>] You shut
out all the air. I choke!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. Now there is only one little crack left.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Air, air&mdash;I cannot breathe!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I paste, I paste.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. That's right, Christine! Heat is expensive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Oh, it feels as if my lips were being glued
together.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Standing in the doorway, with a paper in his
hand</i>] Is the child asleep?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, at last.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Gently</i>] All this crying scares away my clients.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Pleasantly</i>] What can be done about it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. We shall have to get a larger place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. We have no money for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. May I open the window&mdash;this bad air is suffocating.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Then the heat escapes, and we shall be cold.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is horrible!&mdash;May we clean up out there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You have not the strength to do any cleaning, nor
have I, and Christine must paste. She must put strips through
the whole house, on every crack, in the ceiling, in the floor,
in the walls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Poverty I was prepared for, but not for dirt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Poverty is always dirty, relatively speaking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. This is worse than I dreamed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. We are not the worst off by far. There is still food
in the pot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But what sort of food?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Cabbage is cheap, nourishing, and good to eat.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. For those who like cabbage&mdash;to me it is repulsive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Why didn't you say so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Because I loved you, I wanted to sacrifice my own
taste.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Then I must sacrifice my taste for cabbage to
you&mdash;for sacrifices must be mutual.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What are we to eat, then? Fish? But you hate fish?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And it is expensive.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. This is worse than I thought it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Kindly</i>] Yes, you see how hard it is&mdash;And the
child that was to become a link and a blessing&mdash;it becomes our
ruin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Dearest, I die in this air, in this room, with
its backyard view, with its baby cries and endless hours of
sleeplessness, with those people out there, and their whinings,
and bickerings, and incriminations&mdash;I shall die here!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. My poor little flower, that has no light and no
air&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And you say that people exist who are still worse
off?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I belong with the envied ones in this locality.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Everything else might be borne if I could only
have some beauty in my home.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I know you are thinking of flowers&mdash;and especially
of heliotropes&mdash;but a plant costs half a dollar, which will buy
us six quarts of milk or a peck of potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I could gladly get along without food if I could
only have some flowers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. There is a kind of beauty that costs nothing&mdash;but
the absence of it in the home is worse than any other torture to
a man with a sense for the beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. If I tell, you will get angry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. We have agreed not to get angry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. We have agreed&mdash;Everything can be over-come, Agnes,
except the short, sharp accents&mdash;Do you know them? Not yet!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. They will never be heard between us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Not as far as it lies on me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Tell me now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Well&mdash;when I come into a room, I look first of all
at the curtains&mdash;[<i>Goes over to the window and straightens
out the curtains</i>] If they hang like ropes or rags, then I
leave soon. And next I take a glance at the chairs&mdash;if they
stand straight along the wall, then I stay. [<i>Puts a chair
back against the wall</i>] Finally I look at the candles in their
sticks&mdash;if they point this way and that, then the whole house is
askew. [<i>Straightens up a candle on the chest of drawers</i>] This
is the kind of beauty, dear heart, that costs nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. <i>With bent head</i>] Beware of the short accents,
Axel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. They were not short.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, they were.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Well, I'll be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What kind of language is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Pardon me, Agnes! But I have suffered as much from
your lack of orderliness as you have suffered from dirt. And I
have not dared to set things right myself, for when I do so, you
get as angry as if I were reproaching you&mdash;ugh! Hadn't we better
quit now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is very difficult to be married&mdash;it is more
difficult than anything else. One has to be an angel, I think!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I think so, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I fear I shall begin to hate you after this!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Woe to us then!&mdash;But let us forestall hatred. I
promise never again to speak of any untidiness&mdash;although it is
torture to me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And I shall eat cabbage though it means agony to
me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. A life of common suffering, then! One's pleasure,
the other one's pain!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Men are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You see that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, but for heaven's sake, let us avoid the
rocks, now when we know them so well.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Let us try! Are we not decent and intelligent
persons? Able to forbear and forgive?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why not smile at mere trifles?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. We&mdash;only we&mdash;can do so. Do you know, I read this
morning&mdash;by the bye, where is the newspaper?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Embarrassed</i>] Which newspaper?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Sharply</i>] Do I keep more than one?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Smile now, and don't speak sharply&mdash;I used your
paper to make the fire with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Violently</i>] Well, I'll be damned!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why don't you smile?&mdash;I burned it because it
ridiculed what is holy to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Which is unholy to me! Yah! [<i>Strikes one clenched
fist against the open palm of the other hand</i>] I smile, I smile
so that my wisdom teeth show&mdash;Of course, I am to be nice, and I
am to swallow my own opinions, and say yes to everything, and
cringe and dissemble! [<i>Tidies the curtains around the bed</i>]
That's it! Now I am going to fix things until you get angry
again&mdash;Agnes, this is simply impossible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Of course it is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And yet we must endure&mdash;not for the sake of our
promises, but for the sake of the child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You are right&mdash;for the sake of the child. Oh,
oh&mdash;we have to endure!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And now I must go out to my clients. Listen to
them&mdash;how they growl with impatience to tear each other, to get
each other fined and jailed&mdash;Lost souls!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Poor, poor people! And this pasting!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She drops her head forward in dumb despair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I paste, I paste.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span> <i>stands at the door, twisting the
door-knob nervously</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. How that knob squeaks! It is as if you were
twisting my heart-strings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I twist, I twist!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Don't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I twist!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>In the office, on the other side of the door,
takes hold of the knob</i>] Will you permit me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Lets go his hold</i>] By all means. Seeing that you
have your degree!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Now all life belongs to me. Every road lies open.
I have mounted Parnassus. The laurel is won. Immortality, fame,
all is mine!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And what are you going to live on?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Live on?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You must have a home, clothes, food&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Oh, that will come&mdash;if you can only find somebody
to love you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. You don't say so!&mdash;You don't&mdash;Paste, Christine,
paste until they cannot breathe!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes out backward, nodding</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CHRISTINE</span>. I paste, I paste&mdash;until they cannot breathe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Will you come with me now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. At once! But where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. To Fairhaven. There it is summer; there the sun is
shining; there we find youth, children, and flowers, singing and
dancing, feasting and frolicking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Then I will go there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Come!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Enters again</i>] Now I go back to my first
hell&mdash;this was the second and greater. The sweeter the hell, the
greater&mdash;And look here, now she has been dropping hair-pins on
the floor again. [<i>He picks up some hair-pins</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. My! but he has discovered the pins also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Also?&mdash;Look at this one. You see two prongs, but it
is only one pin. It is two, yet only one. If I bend it open, it
is a single piece. If I bend it back, there are two, but they
remain one for all that. It means: these two are one. But if I
break&mdash;like this!&mdash;then they become two.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Breaks the pin and throws the pieces away</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. All that he has seen!&mdash;But before breaking, the
prongs must diverge. If they point together, then it holds.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And if they are parallel, then they will never
meet&mdash;and it neither breaks nor holds.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. The hair-pin is the most perfect of all created
things. A straight line which equals two parallel ones.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. A lock that shuts when it is open.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. And thus shuts in a braid of hair that opens up
when the lock shuts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. It is like this door. When I close it, then I
open&mdash;the way out&mdash;for you, Agnes!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Withdraws and closes the door behind him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Well then?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The stage changes. The bed with its curtains becomes
a tent</i>.</p>

<p><i>The stove stays as it was. The background is
raised. To the right, in the foreground, are seen
hills stripped of their trees by fire, and red
heather growing between the blackened tree stumps.
Red-painted pig-sties and outhouses. Beyond these, in
the open, apparatus for mechanical gymnastics, where
sick persons are being treated on machines resembling
instruments of torture</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the left, in the foreground, the quarantine
station, consisting of open sheds, with ovens,

<p><i>In the middle distance, a narrow strait</i>.</p>

<p><i>The background shows a beautiful wooded shore. Flags
are flying on its piers, where ride white sailboats,

<p><span class="small-c">THE MASTER OF QUARANTINE</span>, <i>made up like a blackamoor,

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Meets him and they shake hands</i>] Why,
Ordström!<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Have you landed here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Yes, here I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Is this Fairhaven?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. No, that is on the other side. This is Foulstrand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Then we have lost our way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. We?&mdash;Won't you introduce me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. No, that wouldn't do. [<i>In a lowered voice</i>] It is
Indra's own daughter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Indra's? And I was thinking of Varuna
himself&mdash;Well, are you not surprised to find me black in the
face?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I am past fifty, my boy, and at that age one has
ceased to be surprised. I concluded at once that you were bound
for some fancy ball this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Right you were! And I hope both of you will come
along.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Why, yes&mdash;for I must say&mdash;the place does not look
very tempting. What kind of people live here anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Here you find the sick; over there, the healthy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Nothing but poor folk on this side, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. No, my boy, it is here you find the rich. Look at
that one on the rack. He has stuffed himself with paté de foie
gras and truffles and Burgundy until his feet have grown knotted.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Knotted?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Yes, he has a case of knotted feet. And that one
who lies under the guillotine&mdash;he has swilled brandy so that his
backbone has to be put through the mangle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. There is always something amiss!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Moreover, everybody living on this side has some
kind of canker to hide. Look at the fellow coming here, for
instance.</p>

<p><i>An old dandy is pushed on the stage in a wheel-chair, he is
accompanied by a gaunt and grisly coquette in the sixties, to
whom</i> <span class="small-c">THE FRIEND</span>, <i>a man of about forty, is paying court</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It is the major&mdash;our schoolmate!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Don Juan. Can you see that he is still enamored of
that old spectre beside him? He does not notice that she has
grown old, or that she is ugly, faithless, cruel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Why, that is love! And I couldn't have dreamt that
a fickle fellow like him would prove capable of loving so deeply
and so earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. That is a mighty decent way of looking at it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I have been in love with Victoria myself&mdash;in fact I
am still waiting for her in the passageway&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Oh, you are the fellow who is waiting in the
passageway?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. I am the man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Well, have you got that door opened yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. No, the case is still in court&mdash;<span class="small-c">THE BILLPOSTER</span> is
out with his dipnet, of course, so that the taking of evidence
is always being put off&mdash;and in the meantime the Glazier has
mended all the window panes in the castle, which has grown half
a story higher&mdash;This has been an uncommonly good year&mdash;warm and
wet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. But just the same you have had no heat comparing
with what I have here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. How much do you have in your ovens?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. When we fumigate cholera suspects, we run it up to
one hundred and forty degrees.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Is the cholera going again?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Don't you know that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Of course, I know it, but I forget so often what I
know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. I wish often that I could forget&mdash;especially
myself. That is why I go in for masquerades and carnivals and
amateur theatricals.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. What have you been up to then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. If I told, they would say that I was boasting; and
if I don't tell, then they call me a hypocrite.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. That is why you blackened your face?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Exactly&mdash;making myself a shade blacker than I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Who is coming there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Oh, a poet who is going to have his mud bath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span> <i>enters with his eyes raised toward the sky
and carrying a pail of mud in one hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Why, he ought to be having light baths and air
baths.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. No, he is roaming about the higher regions so much
that he gets homesick for the mud&mdash;and wallowing in the mire
makes the skin callous like that of a pig. Then he cannot feel
the stings of the wasps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. This is a queer world, full of contradictions.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. [<i>Ecstatically</i>] Man was created by the god Phtah out
of clay on a potter's wheel, or a lathe&mdash;[<i>sceptically</i>], or any
damned old thing! [<i>Ecstatically</i>] Out of clay does the sculptor
create his more or less immortal masterpieces&mdash;[<i>sceptically</i>],
which mostly are pure rot. [<i>Ecstatically</i>] Out of clay they
make those utensils which are so indispensable in the pantry and
which generically are named pots and plates&mdash;[<i>sceptically</i>],
but what in thunder does it matter to me what they are called
anyhow? [<i>Ecstatically</i>] Such is the clay! When clay becomes
fluid, it is called mud&mdash;C'est mon affaire!&mdash;[<i>shouts</i>] Lena!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span> <i>enters with a pail in her hand</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Lena, show yourself to Miss Agnes&mdash;She knew you
ten years ago, when you were a young, happy and, let us say,
pretty girl&mdash;Behold how she looks now. Five children, drudgery,
baby-cries, hunger, ill-treatment. See how beauty has perished
and joy vanished in the fulfilment of duties which should have
brought that inner satisfaction which makes each line in the
face harmonious and fills the eye with a quiet glow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. [<i>Covering the poet's mouth with his hand</i>] Shut
up! Shut up!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. That is what they all say. And if you keep silent,
then they cry: speak! Oh, restless humanity!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Goes to</i> Lena] Tell me your troubles.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span>. No, I dare not, for then they will be made worse.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who could be so cruel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LENA</span>. I dare not tell, for if I do, I shall be spanked.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. That is just what will happen. But I will speak, even
though the blackamoor knock out all my teeth&mdash;I will tell that
justice is not always done&mdash;Agnes, daughter of the gods, do you
hear music and dancing on the hill over there?&mdash;Well, it is
Lena's sister who has come home from the city where she went
astray&mdash;you understand? Now they are killing the fatted calf;
but Lena, who stayed at home, has to carry slop pails and feed
the pigs.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. There is rejoicing at home because the stray has
left the paths of evil, and not merely because she has come
back. Bear that in mind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. But then they should give a ball and banquet every
night for the spotless worker that never strayed into paths of
error&mdash;Yet they do nothing of the kind, but when Lena has a free
moment, she is sent to prayer-meetings where she has to hear
reproaches for not being perfect. Is this justice?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Your question is so difficult to answer
because&mdash;There are so many unforeseen cases <span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. That much
the Caliph, Haroun the Just, came to understand. He was sitting
on his throne, and from its height he could never make out what
happened below. At last complaints penetrated to his exalted
ears. And then, one fine day, he disguised himself and descended
unobserved among the crowds to find out what kind of justice
they were getting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I hope you don't take me for Haroun the Just!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Let us talk of something else&mdash;Here come visitors.</p>

<p><i>A white boat, shaped like a viking ship, with a dragon for
figure-head, with a pale-blue silken sail on a gilded yard, and
with a rose-red standard flying from the top of a gilded mast,
glides through the strait from the left.</i> He <i>and</i> She <i>are
seated in the stern with their arms around each other</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Behold perfect happiness, bliss without limits,
young love's rejoicing!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The stage grows brighter</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span>. [<i>Stands up in the boat and sings</i>]</p>

<p>
Hail, beautiful haven,<br />
Where the Springs of my youth were spent,<br />
Where my first sweet dreams were dreamt&mdash;<br />
To thee I return,<br />
But lonely no longer!<br />
Ye hills and groves,<br />
Thou sky o'erhead,<br />
Thou mirroring sea,<br />
Give greeting to her:<br />
My love, my bride,<br />
My light and my life!<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The flags at the landings of Fairhaven are dipped in
salute; white handkerchiefs are waved from verandahs
and boats, and the air is filled with tender chords
from harps and violins</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. See the light that surrounds them! Hear how the air is
ringing with music!&mdash;Eros!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It is Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Well, what of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It is his Victoria&mdash;My own is still mine. And
nobody can see <i>her</i>&mdash;Now you hoist the quarantine flag, and I
shall pull in the net.</p>

<p>[The <span class="small-c">MASTER OF QUARANTINE</span> <i>waves a yellow flag.</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>.
[<i>Pulling a rope that turns the boat toward Foulstrand</i>] Hold on
there!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">SHE</span> <i>become aware of the hideous view and
give vent to their horror</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Yes, it comes hard. But here every one must stop
who hails from plague-stricken places.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. The idea of speaking in such manner, of acting in such
a way, within the presence of two human beings united in love!
Touch them not! Lay not hands on love! It is treason!&mdash;Woe to
us! Everything beautiful must now be dragged down&mdash;dragged into
the mud!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">HE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">SHE</span> <i>step ashore, looking sad and
shamefaced</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span>. Woe to us! What have we done?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. It is not necessary to have done anything in order
to encounter life's little pricks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. So short-lived are joy and happiness!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span>. How long must we stay here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Forty days and nights.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. Then rather into the water!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span>. To live here&mdash;among blackened hills and pig-sties?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Love overcomes all, even sulphur fumes and carbolic
acid.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. [<i>Starts a fire in the stove; blue, sulphurous
flames break forth</i>] Now I set the sulphur going. Will you
please step in?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. Oh, my blue dress will fade.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. And become white. So your roses will also turn
white in time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HE</span>. Even your cheeks&mdash;in forty days!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>] That will please you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. No, it will not!&mdash;Of course, your happiness was
the cause of my suffering, but&mdash;it doesn't matter&mdash;for I am
graduated and have obtained a position over there&mdash;heigh-ho
and alas! And in the Fall I shall be teaching school&mdash;teaching
boys the same lessons I myself learned during my childhood and
youth&mdash;the same lessons throughout my manhood and, finally, in
my old age&mdash;the self-same lessons! What does twice two make?
How many times can four be evenly divided by two?&mdash;Until I
get a pension and can do nothing at all&mdash;just wait around for
meals and the newspapers&mdash;until at last I am carted to the
crematorium and burned to ashes&mdash;Have you nobody here who is
entitled to a pension? Barring twice two makes four, it is
probably the worst thing of all&mdash;to begin school all over again
when one already is graduated; to ask the same questions until
death comes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>An elderly man goes by, with his hands folded behind
his back</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. There is a pensioner now, waiting for himself to
die. I think he must be a captain who missed the rank of major;
or an assistant judge who was not made a chief justice. Many are
called but few are chosen&mdash;He is waiting for his breakfast now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PENSIONER</span>. No, for the newspaper&mdash;the morning paper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. And he is only fifty-four years old. He may spend
twenty-five more years waiting for meals and newspapers&mdash;is it
not dreadful?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PENSIONER</span>. What is not dreadful? Tell me, tell me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Tell that who can!&mdash;Now I shall have to teach
boys that twice two makes four. And how many times four can be
evenly divided by two. [<i>He clutches his head in despair</i>] And
Victoria, whom I loved and therefore wished all the happiness
life can give&mdash;now she has her happiness, the greatest one known
to her, and for this reason I suffer&mdash;suffer, suffer!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. Do you think I can be happy when I see you suffering? How
can you think it? Perhaps it will soothe your pains that I am to
be imprisoned here for forty days and nights? Tell me, does it
soothe your pains?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes and no. How can I enjoy seeing you suffer? Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHE</span>. And do you think my happiness can be founded on your
torments?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. We are to be pitied&mdash;all of us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. [<i>Raise their arms toward the sky and utter a cry of
anguish that sounds like a dissonant chord</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Everlasting One, hear them! Life is evil! Men are
to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. [<i>As before</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><i>For a moment the stage is completely darkened, and
during that moment everybody withdraws or takes up
a new position. When the light is turned on again,
Foulstrand is seen in the background, lying in deep
shadow. The strait is in the middle distance and
Fairhaven in the foreground, both steeped in light.
To the right, a corner of the Casino, where dancing
couples are visible through the open windows. Three
servant maids are standing outside on top of an empty
box, with arms around each other, staring at the
dancers within. On the verandah of the Casino stands
a bench, where</i> "Plain" <span class="small-c">EDITH</span> <i>is sitting. She is

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Here is peace, and happiness, and leisure. No more
toil; every day a holiday; everybody dressed up in their best;
dancing and music in the early morning. [<i>To the maids</i>] Why
don't you go in and have a dance, girls?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MAIDS</span>. We?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. They are servants, don't you see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Of course!&mdash;But why is Edith sitting there instead
of dancing?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">EDITH</span> <i>buries her face in her hands</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">EDITH</span>. Because&mdash;I cannot throw myself at them. That I am ugly, I
know, and I know that nobody wants to dance with me, but I might
be spared from being reminded of it.</p>

makes two-two.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. I see! You have not studied your lesson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Ashamed</i>] Yes, I have, but&mdash;I know the answer,
but I cannot tell it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. You want to wriggle out of it, of course. You know
it, but you cannot tell. Perhaps I may help you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pulls his hair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Oh, it is dreadful, it is dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Yes, it is dreadful that such a big boy lacks all
ambition&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Hurt</i>] Big boy&mdash;yes, I am big&mdash;bigger than all
these others&mdash;I am full-grown, I am done with school&mdash;[<i>As if
waking up</i>] I have graduated&mdash;why am I then sitting here? Have I
not received my doctor's degree?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Certainly, but you are to sit here and mature, you
know. You have to mature&mdash;isn't that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Feels his forehead</i>] Yes, that is right, one
must mature&mdash;Twice two&mdash;makes two&mdash;and this I can demonstrate
by analogy, which is the highest form of all reasoning.
Listen!&mdash;Once one makes one; consequently twice two must make
two. For what applies in one case must also apply in another.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Your conclusion is based on good logic, but your
answer is wrong.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. What is logical cannot be wrong. Let us test it.
One divided by one gives one, so that two divided by two must
give two.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Correct according to analogy. But how much does
once three make?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Three, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Consequently twice three must also make three.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Pondering</i>] No, that cannot be right&mdash;it
cannot&mdash;or else&mdash;[<i>Sits down dejectedly</i>] No, I am not mature
yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. No, indeed, you are far from mature.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. But how long am I to sit here, then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Here&mdash;how long? Do you believe that time and space
exist?&mdash;Suppose that time does exist, then you should be able to
say what time is. What is time?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Time&mdash;[<i>Thinks</i>] I cannot tell, but I know what it
is. Consequently I may also know what twice two is without being
able to tell it. And, teacher, can you tell what time is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Of course I can.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL THE BOYS</span>. Tell us then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Time&mdash;let me see. [<i>Stands immovable until
one finger on his nose</i>] While we are talking, time flies.
Consequently time is something that flies while we talk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">A BOY</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Now you are talking, teacher, and while you
are talking, I fly: consequently I am time. [<i>Runs out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. That accords completely with the laws of logic.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Then the laws of logic are silly, for Nils who ran
away, cannot be time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. That is also good logic, although it is silly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Then logic itself is silly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. So it seems. But if logic is silly, then all the
world is silly&mdash;and then the devil himself wouldn't stay here to
teach you more silliness. If anybody treats me to a drink, we'll
go and take a bath.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. That is a <i>posterus prius</i>, or the world turned
upside down, for it is customary to bathe first and have the
drink afterward. Old fogy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. Beware of a swelled head, doctor!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Call me captain, if you please. I am an officer,
and I cannot understand why I should be sitting here to get
scolded like a schoolboy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. [<i>With raised index finger</i>] We were to mature!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] The quarantine begins.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Oh, there you are. Just think of it, this fellow
makes me sit among the boys although I am graduated.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Well, why don't you go away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Heaven knows!&mdash;Go away? Why, that is no easy thing
to do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span>. I guess not&mdash;just try!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">MASTER OF QUARANTINE</span>] Save me! Save me from
his eye!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Come on. Come and help us dance&mdash;We have to dance
before the plague breaks out. We must!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Is the brig leaving?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. Yes, first of all the brig must leave&mdash;Then there
will be a lot of tears shed, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Always tears: when she comes and when she goes&mdash;Let
us get out of here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>They go out</i>. <span class="small-c">THE TEACHER</span> <i>continues his lesson in
silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE MAIDS</span> <i>that were staring through the window of
the dance hall walk sadly down to the pier</i>. <span class="small-c">EDITH</span>,
<i>who has been standing like a statue at the piano,
follows them</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>] Is there not one happy person
to be found in this paradise?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes, there is a newly married couple. Just watch
them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE</span> <i>enter</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. [<i>To his</i> <span class="small-c">WIFE</span>] My joy has no limits, and I could now
wish to die&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Why die?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Because at the heart of happiness grows the seed of
disaster. Happiness devours itself like a flame&mdash;it cannot burn
for ever, but must go out some time. And this presentiment of
the coming end destroys joy in the very hour of its culmination.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">WIFE</span>. Let us then die together&mdash;this moment!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">HUSBAND</span>. Die? All right! For I fear happiness&mdash;that cheat!
[<i>They go toward the water</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Life is evil! Men are to be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Look at this fellow. He is the most envied mortal
in this neighbourhood.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span> <i>is led in</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. He is the owner of these hundred or more Italian
villas. He owns all these bays, straits, shores, forests,
together with the fishes in the water, the birds in the air,
the game in the woods. These thousand or more people are his
tenants. The sun rises upon his sea and sets upon his land&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Well&mdash;is he complaining also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Yes, and with right, for he cannot see.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MASTER OF Q</span>. He is blind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The most envied of all!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Now he has come to see the brig depart with his son
on board.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span>. I cannot see, but I hear. I hear the anchor bill
claw the clay bottom as when the hook is torn out of a fish and
brings up the heart with it through the neck&mdash;My son, my only
child, is going to journey across the wide sea to foreign lands,
and I can follow him only in my thought! Now I hear the clanking
of the chain&mdash;and&mdash;there is something that snaps and cracks like
clothes drying on a line&mdash;wet handkerchiefs perhaps. And I hear
it blubber and snivel as when people are weeping&mdash;maybe the
splashing of the wavelets among the seines&mdash;or maybe girls along
the shore, deserted and disconsolate&mdash;Once I asked a child why
the ocean is salt, and the child, which had a father on a long
trip across the high seas, said immediately: the ocean is salt
because the sailors shed so many tears into it. And why do the
sailors cry so much then?&mdash;Because they are always going away,
replied the child; and that is why they are always drying their
handkerchiefs in the rigging&mdash;And why does man weep when he is
sad? I asked at last&mdash;Because the glass in the eyes must be
washed now and then, so that we can see clearly, said the child.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The brig has set sail and is gliding off. The
girls along the shore are alternately waving their
handkerchiefs and wiping off their tears with them.
Then a signal is set on the foremast&mdash;a red ball in a
white field, meaning "yes." In response to it</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>
<i>waves her handkerchief triumphantly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>] What is the meaning of that
flag?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It means "yes." It is the lieutenant's troth&mdash;red
as the red blood of the arteries, set against the blue cloth of
the sky.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And how does "no" look?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. It is blue as the spoiled blood in the veins&mdash;but
look, how jubilant Alice is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And how Edith cries.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span>. Meet and part. Part and meet. That is life. I met
his mother. And then she went away from me. He was left to me;
and now he goes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But he will come back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span>. Who is speaking to me? I have heard that voice
before&mdash;in my dreams; in my youth, when vacation began; in the
early years of my marriage, when my child was born. Every time
life smiled at me, I heard that voice, like a whisper of the
south wind, like a chord of harps from above, like what I feel
the angels' greeting must be in the Holy Night&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span> <i>enters and goes up to whisper something
into</i> <span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span>'s <i>ear</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE BLIND MAN</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. That's the truth. [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>] Now you
have seen most of it, but you have not yet tried the worst of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What can that be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Repetition&mdash;recurrence. To retrace one's own tracks;
to be sent back to the task once finished&mdash;come!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. To your duties.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Everything you dread. Everything you do not want but
must. It means to forego, to give up, to do without, to lack&mdash;it
means everything that is unpleasant, repulsive, painful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Are there no pleasant duties?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. They become pleasant when they are done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. When they have ceased to exist&mdash;Duty is then
something unpleasant. What is pleasant then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. What is pleasant is sin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Sin?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, something that has to be punished. If I have
had a pleasant day or night, then I suffer infernal pangs and a
bad conscience the next day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. How strange!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I wake up in the morning with a headache; and then
the repetitions begin, but so that everything becomes perverted.
What the night before was pretty, agreeable, witty, is presented
by memory in the morning as ugly, distasteful, stupid. Pleasure
seems to decay, and all joy goes to pieces. What men call
success serves always as a basis for their next failure. My own
successes have brought ruin upon me. For men view the fortune
of others with an instinctive dread. They regard it unjust that
fate should favour any one man, and so they try to restore
balance by piling rocks on the road. To have talent is to be
in danger of one's life, for then one may easily starve to
death!&mdash;However, you will have to return to your duties, or I
shall bring suit against you, and we shall pass through every
court up to the highest&mdash;one, two, three!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Return?&mdash;To the iron stove, and the cabbage pot,
and the baby clothes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Exactly! We have a big wash to-day, for we must wash
all the handkerchiefs&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Oh, must I do it all over again?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. All life is nothing but doing things over again.
Look at the teacher in there&mdash;He received his doctor's degree
yesterday, was laurelled and saluted, climbed Parnassus and was
embraced by the monarch&mdash;and to-day he starts school all over
again, asks how much twice two makes, and will continue to do
so until his death&mdash;However, you must come back to your home!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I shall rather die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Die?&mdash;That is not allowed. First of all, it is a
disgrace&mdash;so much so that even the dead body is subjected to
insults; and secondly, one goes to hell&mdash;it is a mortal sin!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is not easy to be human!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. Hear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I shall not go back with you to humiliation and
dirt&mdash;I am longing for the heights whence I came&mdash;but first the
door must be opened so that I may learn the secret&mdash;It is my
will that the door be opened!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Then you must retrace your own steps, cover the road
you have already travelled, suffer all annoyances, repetitions,
tautologies, recopyings, that a suit will bring with it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. May it come then&mdash;But first I must go into the
solitude and the wilderness to recover my own self. We shall
meet again! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE POET</span>] Follow me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Cries of anguish are heard from a distance</i>. Woe!
Woe! Woe!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. The lost souls at Foulstrand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why do they wail more loudly than usual to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Because the sun is shining here; because here we
have music, dancing, youth. And it makes them feel their own
sufferings more keenly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. We must set them free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Try it! Once a liberator appeared, and he was nailed
to a cross.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. By whom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. By all the right-minded.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who are they?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Are you not acquainted with all the right-minded?
Then you must learn to know them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Were they the ones that prevented your graduation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Then I know them!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SECOND HEAVER</span>. The police won't let us. No bathing here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST HEAVER</span>. Couldn't we pick some fruit off that tree?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SECOND HEAVER</span>. Then the police would get after us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SECOND HEAVER</span>. Then the police will get you for sure!&mdash;
[<i>Pause</i>] And you wouldn't have anything to eat anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST HEAVER</span>. Nothing to eat? We, who work hardest, get least
food; and the rich, who do nothing, get most. Might one
not&mdash;without disregard of truth&mdash;assert that this is injustice
&mdash;What has the daughter of the gods to say about it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I can say nothing at all&mdash;But tell me, what have
you done that makes you so black and your lot so hard?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST HEAVER</span>. What have we done? We have been born of poor and
perhaps not very good parents&mdash;Maybe we have been punished a
couple of times.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Punished?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST HEAVER</span>. Yes, the unpunished hang out in the Casino up
there and dine on eight courses with wine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>] Can that be true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. On the whole, yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You mean to say that every man at some time has
deserved to go to prison?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Is it true that the poor cannot bathe in the sea?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes. Not even with their clothes on. None but those
who intend to take their own lives escape being fined. And those
are said to get a good drubbing at the police station.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But can they not go outside of the city, out into
the country, and bathe there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. There is no place for them&mdash;all the land is fenced
in.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But I mean in the free, open country.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. There is no such thing&mdash;it all belongs to somebody.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Even the sea, the great, vast sea&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Even that! You cannot sail the sea in a boat and
land anywhere without having it put down in writing and charged
for. It is lovely!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. This is not paradise.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. I should say not!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why don't men do something to improve their lot?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Oh, they try, of course, but all the improvers end
in prison or in the madhouse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who puts them in prison?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. All the right-minded, all the respectable&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who sends them to the madhouse?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Their own despair when they grasp the hopelessness
of their efforts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Has the thought not occurred to anybody, that for
secret reasons it must be as it is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, those who are well off always think so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. That it is all right as it is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">FIRST HEAVER</span>. And yet we are the foundations of society. If the
coal is not unloaded, then there will be no fire in the kitchen
stove, in the parlour grate, or in the factory furnace; then the

we name Indra's Ear because it is the place where the king of
the heavens is said to listen to the complaints of the mortals.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. What? In this place?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Do you see how this cave is built like a shell?
Yes, you can see it. Do you know that your ear, too, is built
in the form of a shell? You know it, but have not thought of
it. [<i>She picks up a shell from the beach</i>] Have you not as a

Foul-smelling breaths,<br />

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. False waves and faithless! Everything on earth
that is not burned, is drowned&mdash;by the waves. Look at this.
[<i>Pointing to pile of debris</i>] See what the sea has taken
and spoiled! Nothing but the figure-heads remain of the
sunken ships&mdash;and the names: <i>Justice</i>, <i>Friendship, Golden
Peace, Hope</i>&mdash;this is all that is left of <i>Hope</i>&mdash;of fickle
<i>Hope</i>&mdash;Railings, tholes, bails! And lo: the life buoy&mdash;which
saved itself and let distressed men perish.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. [<i>Searching in the pile</i>] Here is the name-board of
the ship <i>Justice</i>. That was the one which left Fairhaven with
the Blind Man's son on board. It is lost then! And with it are
gone the lover of Alice, the hopeless love of Edith.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The Blind Man? Fairhaven? I must have been
dreaming of them. And the lover of Alice, "Plain" Edith,
Foulstrand and the Quarantine, sulphur and carbolic acid, the
graduation in the church, the Lawyer's office, the passageway
and Victoria, the Growing Castle and the Officer&mdash;All this I
have been dreaming&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. It was in one of my poems.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You know then what poetry is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I know then what dreaming is&mdash;But what is poetry?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Not reality, but more than reality&mdash;not dreaming,
but daylight dreams&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. And the man-children think that we poets are only
playing&mdash;that we invent and make believe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And fortunate it is, my friend, for otherwise the
world would lie fallow for lack of ministration. Everybody would
be stretched on his back, staring into the sky. Nobody would be
touching plough or spade, hammer or plane.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. And you say this, Indra's daughter, you who belong in
part up there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You do right in reproaching me. Too long have I
stayed down here taking mud baths like you&mdash;My thoughts have
lost their power of flight; there is clay on their wings&mdash;mire
on their feet&mdash;and I myself&mdash;[<i>raising her arms</i>] I sink, I
sink&mdash;Help me, father, Lord of the Heavens! [<i>Silence</i>] I can
no longer hear his answer. The ether no longer carries the
sound from his lips to my ear's shell the silvery thread has
snapped&mdash;Woe is me, I am earthbound!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Do you mean to ascend&mdash;soon?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. As soon as I have consigned this mortal shape to
the flames&mdash;for even the waters of the ocean cannot cleanse me.
Why do you question me thus?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Because I have a prayer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What kind of prayer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. A written supplication from humanity to the ruler of
the universe, formulated by a dreamer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. To be presented by whom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. By Indra's daughter.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Can you repeat what you have written?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I can.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Speak it then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Better that you do it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Where can I read it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. In my mind&mdash;or here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Hands her a roll of paper.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Receives the roll, but reads without looking at
it</i>] Well, by me it shall be spoken then:</p>

<p class="poet">
"Why must you be born in anguish?<br />
Why, O man-child, must you always<br />
Wring your mother's heart with torture<br />
When you bring her joy maternal,<br />
Highest happiness yet known?<br />
Why to life must you awaken,<br />
Why to light give natal greeting,<br />
With a cry of anger and of pain?<br />
Why not meet it smiling, man-child,<br />
When the gift of life is counted<br />
In itself a boon unmatched?<br />
Why like beasts should we be coming,<br />
We of race divine and human?<br />
Better garment craves the spirit<br />
Than one made of filth and blood!<br />
Need a god his teeth be changing&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
<br />
&mdash;Silence, rash one! Is it seemly<br />
For the work to blame its maker?<br />
No one yet has solved life's riddle.<br />
<br />
"Thus begins the human journey<br />
O'er a road of thorns and thistles;<br />
If a beaten path be offered.<br />
It is named at once forbidden;<br />
If a flower you covet, straightway<br />
You are told it is another's;<br />
If a field should bar your progress,<br />
And you dare to break across it,<br />
You destroy your neighbour's harvest;<br />
Others then your own will trample,<br />
That the measure may be evened!<br />
Every moment of enjoyment<br />
Brings to some one else a sorrow,<br />
But your sorrow gladdens no one,<br />
For from sorrow naught but sorrow springs.<br />
<br />
"Thus you journey till you die,<br />
And your death brings others' bread."<br />
<br />
&mdash;Is it thus that you approach,<br />
Son of Dust, the One Most High?<br />
</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>.</p>

<p class="poet">
Could the son of dust discover<br />
Words so pure and bright and simple<br />
That to heaven they might ascend&mdash;&mdash;?<br />
<br />
Child of gods, wilt thou interpret<br />
Mankind's grievance in some language<br />
That immortals understand?<br />
</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I will.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. [<i>Pointing to the buoy</i>] What is that floating
there?&mdash;A buoy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. It looks like a lung with a windpipe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is the watchman of the seas. When danger is
abroad, it sings.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. It seems to me as if the sea were rising and the waves
growing larger&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Not unlikely.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Woe! What do I see? A ship bearing down upon the reef.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What ship can that be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. The ghost ship of the seas, I think.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What ship is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. The <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Oh, that one. Why is he punished so hard, and why
does he not seek harbour?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Because he had seven faithless wives.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And for this he should be punished?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Yes, all the right-minded condemned him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Strange world, this!&mdash;How can he then be freed
from his curse?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Freed?&mdash;Oh, they take good care that none is set free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Because&mdash;No, it is not the <i>Dutchman</i>! It is an
ordinary ship in distress. Why does not the buoy cry out now?
Look, how the sea is rising&mdash;how high the waves are&mdash;soon we
shall be unable to get out of the cave! Now the ship's bell is
ringing&mdash;Soon we shall have another figure-head. Cry out, buoy!
Do your duty, watchman! [<i>The buoy sounds a four-voice chord
of fifths and sixths, reminding one of fog horns</i>] The crew is
signalling to us&mdash;but we are doomed ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Do you not wish to be set free?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Yes, of course&mdash;of course, I wish it&mdash;but not just
now, and not by water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE CREW</span>. [<i>Sings in quartet</i>] Christ Kyrie!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/music02.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Now they are crying aloud, and so is the sea, but no
one gives ear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE CREW</span>. [<i>As before</i>] Christ Kyrie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who is coming there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Walking on the waters? There is only one who does
that&mdash;and it is not Peter, the Rock, for he sank like a stone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A white light is seen shining over the water at some
distance</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE CREW</span>. Christ Kyrie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Can this be He?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. It is He, the crucified&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Why&mdash;tell me&mdash;why was He crucified?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Because He wanted to set free&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Who was it&mdash;I have forgotten&mdash;that crucified Him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. All the right-minded.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What a strange world!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. The sea is rising. Darkness is closing in upon us. The
storm is growing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">THE CREW</span> <i>set up a wild outcry</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. The crew scream with horror at the sight of their
Saviour&mdash;and now&mdash;they are leaping overboard for fear of the
Redeemer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">THE CREW</span> <i>utter another cry</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Now they are crying because they must die. Crying when
they are born, and crying when they pass away!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The rising waves threaten to engulf the two in the
cave</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. If I could only be sure that it is a ship&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Really&mdash;I don't think it is a ship&mdash;It is a
two-storied house with trees in front of it&mdash;and&mdash;a telephone
tower&mdash;a tower that reaches up into the skies&mdash;It is the
modern Tower of Babel sending wires to the upper regions&mdash;to
communicate with those above&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Child, the human thought needs no wires to make a
way for itself&mdash;the prayers of the pious penetrate the universe.
It cannot be a Tower of Babel, for if you want to assail the
heavens, you must do so with prayer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. No, it is no house&mdash;no telephone tower&mdash;don't you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What are you seeing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I see an open space covered with snow&mdash;a drill
ground&mdash;The winter sun is shining from behind a church on a
hill, and the tower is casting its long shadow on the snow&mdash;Now
a troop of soldiers come marching across the grounds. They march
up along the tower, up the spire. Now they have reached the
cross, but I have a feeling that the first one who steps on the
gilded weathercock at the top must die. Now they are near it&mdash;a
corporal is leading them&mdash;ha-ha! There comes a cloud sweeping
across the open space, and right in front of the sun, of
course&mdash;now everything is gone&mdash;the water in the cloud put out
the sun's fire!&mdash;The light of the sun created the shadow picture
of the tower, but the shadow picture of the cloud swallowed the
shadow picture of the tower&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>] Has the Lord Chancellor
arrived yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And the Deans of the Faculties?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Call them at once, then, for the door is to be
opened&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. Is it so very pressing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, it is. For there is a suspicion that the
solution of the world-riddle may be hidden behind it. Call the
Lord Chancellor, and the Deans of the Four Faculties also.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span> <i>blows in a whistle</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And do not forget the Glazier and his diamond, for
without them nothing can be done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE PORTRESS</span>. The young lady will be coming in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. Good! The carriage is waiting, the table is set,

<p><span class="small-c">THE OFFICER</span>. [<i>Begins to walk to and fro</i>] Good! I am waiting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. It seems to me that all this has happened before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. So it seems to me also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Perhaps I have dreamt it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Or put it in a poem, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Or put it in a poem.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Then you know what poetry is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Then I know what dreaming is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It seems to me that we have said all this to each
other before, in some other place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Then you may soon figure out what reality is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Or dreaming!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Or poetry!</p>

FACULTIES</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. It is about the opening of that door, of
course&mdash;What does the Dean of the Theological Faculty think of
it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DEAN OF THEOLOGY</span>. I do not think&mdash;I believe&mdash;<i>Credo</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DEAN OF PHILOSOPHY</span>. I hold&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DEAN OF MEDICINE</span>. I know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DEAN OF JURISPRUDENCE</span>. I doubt until I have evidence and
witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Now they are fighting again!&mdash;Well, what does
Theology believe?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. I believe that this door must not be opened, because
it hides dangerous truths&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. Truth is never dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. What is truth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. What can be proved by two witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. Anything can be proved by two false witnesses&mdash;thinks
the pettifogger.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. Truth is wisdom, and wisdom, knowledge, is
philosophy itself&mdash;Philosophy is the science of sciences, the
knowledge of knowing, and all other sciences are its servants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. Natural science is the only true science&mdash;and
philosophy is no science at all. It is nothing but empty
speculation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. Good!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>] Good, you say! And what are you,
then? You are the arch-enemy of all knowledge; you are the very
antithesis of knowledge; you are ignorance and obscuration&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. Good!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>] You cry "good," you, who cannot see
beyond the length of your own nose in the magnifying glass; who
believes in nothing but your own unreliable senses&mdash;in your
vision, for instance, which may be far-sighted, near-sighted,
blind, purblind, cross-eyed, one-eyed, colour-blind, red-blind,
green-blind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. Idiot!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. Ass! [<i>They fight</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Peace! One crow does not peck out the other's
eye.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. If I had to choose between those two, Theology and
Medicine, I should choose&mdash;neither!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. And if I had to sit in judgment on the three of
you, I should find&mdash;all guilty! You cannot agree on a single
point, and you never could. Let us get back to the case in
court. What is the opinion of the Lord Chancellor as to this
door and its opening?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Opinion? I have no opinion whatever. I am
merely appointed by the government to see that you don't break
each other's arms and legs in the Council&mdash;while you are
educating the young! Opinion? Why, I take mighty good care to
avoid everything of the kind. Once I had one or two, but they
were refuted at once. Opinions are always refuted&mdash;by their
opponents, of course&mdash;But perhaps we might open the door now,
even with the risk of finding some dangerous truths behind it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. What is truth? What is truth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. I am the truth and the life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. I am the science of sciences&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. I am the only exact science&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. I doubt&mdash;&mdash; [<i>They fight</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Instructors of the young, take shame!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. Lord Chancellor, as representative of the
government, as head of the corps of instructors, you must
prosecute this woman's offence. She has told all of you to
take shame, which is an insult; and she has&mdash;in a sneering,
ironical sense&mdash;called you instructors of the young, which is a
slanderous speech.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Poor youth!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. She pities the young, which is to accuse us. Lord
Chancellor, you must prosecute the offence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, I accuse you&mdash;you in a body&mdash;of sowing doubt
and discord in the minds of the young.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. Listen to her&mdash;she herself is making the young
question our authority, and then she charges us with sowing
doubt. Is it not a criminal act, I ask all the right-minded?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL RIGHT-MINDED</span>. Yes, it is criminal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. All the right-minded have condemned you. Leave in
peace with your lucre, or else&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. My lucre? Or else? What else?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. Else you will be stoned.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Or crucified.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I leave. Follow me, and you shall learn the riddle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Which riddle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What did he mean with "my lucre"?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Probably nothing at all. That kind of thing we call
talk. He was just talking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. But it was what hurt me more than anything else!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. That is why he said it, I suppose&mdash;Men are that way.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL RIGHT-MINDED</span>. Hooray! The door is open.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. What was behind the door?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE GLAZIER</span>. I can see nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. He cannot see anything&mdash;of course, he cannot!
Deans of the Faculties: what was behind that door?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THEOLOGY</span>. Nothing! That is the solution of the world-riddle. In
the beginning God created heaven and the earth out of nothing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PHILOSOPHY</span>. Out of nothing comes nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. Yes, bosh&mdash;which is nothing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JURISPRUDENCE</span>. I doubt. And this is a case of deception. I
appeal to all the right-minded.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE POET</span>] Who are the right-minded?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Who can tell? Frequently all the right-minded consist
of a single person. To-day it is me and mine; to-morrow it is
you and yours. To that position you are appointed&mdash;or rather,
you appoint yourself to it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL RIGHT-MINDED</span>. We have been deceived.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Who has deceived you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL RIGHT-MINDED</span>. The Daughter!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Will the Daughter please tell us what she meant
by having this door opened?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No, friends. If I did, you would not believe me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. Why, then, there is nothing there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You have said it&mdash;but you have not understood.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MEDICINE</span>. It is bosh, what she says!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. Bosh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">THE POET</span>] They are to be pitied.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Are you in earnest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Always in earnest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Do you think the right-minded are to be pitied also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. They most of all, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. And the four faculties, too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. They also, and not the least. Four heads, four
minds, and one body. Who made that monster?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. She has not answered!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Stone her then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I have answered.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LORD CHANCELLOR</span>. Hear&mdash;she answers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span>. Stone her! She answers!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Whether she answer or do not answer, stone her!
Come, prophet, and I shall tell you the riddle&mdash;but far away
from here&mdash;out in the desert, where no one can hear us, no one
see us, for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. [<i>Enters and takes</i> <span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span> <i>by the arm</i>] Have
you forgotten your duties?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Oh, heavens, no! But I have higher duties.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. And your child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. My child&mdash;what of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Your child is crying for you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. My child! Woe, I am earth-bound! And this pain in
my breast, this anguish&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Don't you know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. It is remorse.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Is that remorse?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, and it follows every neglected duty; every
pleasure, even the most innocent, if innocent pleasures exist,
which seems doubtful; and every suffering inflicted upon one's
fellow-beings.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And there is no remedy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Yes, but only one. It consists in doing your duty at
once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You look like a demon when you speak that word
duty&mdash;And when, as in my case, there are two duties to be met?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Meet one first, and then the other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The highest first&mdash;therefore, you look after my
child, and I shall do my duty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Your child suffers because it misses you&mdash;can you
bear to know that a human being is suffering for your sake?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Now strife has entered my soul&mdash;it is rent in two,
and the halves are being pulled in opposite directions!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Such, you know, are life's little discords.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Oh, how it is pulling!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. If you could only know how I have spread sorrow and
ruin around me by the exercise of my calling&mdash;and note that
I say <i>calling</i>, which carries with it the highest duty of
all&mdash;then you would not even touch my hand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I had a father who put his whole hope on me as his
only son, destined to continue his enterprise. I ran away from
the business college. My father grieved himself to death. My
mother wanted me to be religious, and I could not do what she
wanted&mdash;and she disowned me. I had a friend who assisted me
through trying days of need&mdash;and that friend acted as a tyrant
against those on whose behalf I was speaking and writing. And
I had to strike down my friend and benefactor in order to save
my soul. Since then I have had no peace. Men call me devoid of
honour, infamous&mdash;and it does not help that my conscience says,
"you have done right," for in the next moment it is saying, "you
have done wrong." Such is life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Come with me into the desert.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE LAWYER</span>. Your child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. [<i>Indicating all those present</i>] Here are my
children. By themselves they are good, but if they only come
together, then they quarrel and turn into demons&mdash;Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. The hour is not distant when, with the help of the
flames, I shall once more ascend to the ether. It is what you
call to die, and what you approach in fear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Fear of the unknown.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Which is known to you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Who knows it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. All! Why do you not believe your prophets?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Prophets have always been disbelieved. Why is that
so? And "if God has spoken, why will men not believe then?" His
convincing power ought to be irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Have you always doubted?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. No. I have had certainty many times. But after a while
it passed away, like a dream when you wake up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. It is not easy to be human!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. You see and admit it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Listen! Was it not Indra that once sent his son down
here to receive the complaints of mankind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Thus it happened&mdash;and how was he received?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. How did he fill his mission?&mdash;to answer with another
question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And if I may reply with still another&mdash;was not
man's position bettered by his visit to the earth? Answer truly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Bettered?&mdash;Yes, a little. A very little&mdash;But instead
of asking questions&mdash;will you not tell the riddle?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes. But to what use? You will not believe me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. In you I shall believe, for I know who you are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Then I shall tell! In the morning of the ages,
before the sun was shining, Brahma, the divine primal force, let
himself be persuaded by Maya, the world-mother, to propagate
himself. This meeting of the divine primal matter with the
earth-matter was the fall of heaven into sin. Thus the world,
existence, mankind, are nothing but a phantom, an appearance, a
dream-image&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. My dream!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. A dream of truth! But in order to free themselves
from the earth-matter, the offspring of Brahma seek privation
and suffering. There you have suffering as a liberator. But this
craving for suffering comes into conflict with the craving for
enjoyment, or love&mdash;do you now understand what love is, with its
utmost joys merged into its utmost sufferings, with its mixture
of what is most sweet and most bitter? Can you now grasp what
woman is? Woman, through whom sin and death found their way into
life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I understand!&mdash;And the end?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You know it: conflict between the pain of
enjoyment and the pleasure of suffering&mdash;between the pangs of
the penitent and the joys of the prodigal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. A conflict it is then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Conflict between opposites produces energy, as
fire and water give the power of steam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. But peace? Rest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Hush! You must ask no more, and I can no longer
answer. The altar is already adorned for the sacrifice&mdash;the
flowers are standing guard&mdash;the candles are lit&mdash;there are white
sheets in the windows&mdash;spruce boughs have been spread in the
gateway&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. And you say this as calmly as if for you suffering did
not exist!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. You think so?&mdash;I have suffered all your
sufferings, but in a hundredfold degree, for my sensations were
so much more acute&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Relate your sorrow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Poet, could you tell yours so that not one word
went too far? Could your word at any time approach your thought?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. No, you are right! To myself I appeared like one
struck dumb, and when the mass listened admiringly to my song,
I found it mere noise&mdash;for this reason, you see, I have always
felt ashamed when they praised me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. And then you ask me&mdash;Look me straight in the eye!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I cannot bear your glance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. How could you bear my word then, were I to speak
in your tongue?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. But tell me at least before you go: from what did you
suffer most of all down here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. From&mdash;<i>being</i>: to feel my vision weakened by an
eye, my hearing blunted by an ear, and my thought, my bright and
buoyant thought, bound in labyrinthine coils of fat. You have
seen a brain&mdash;what roundabout and sneaking paths&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Well, that is because all the right-minded think
crookedly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Malicious, always malicious, all of you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. How could one possibly be otherwise?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. First of all I now shake the dust from my
feet&mdash;the dirt and the clay&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Leaves with the other two</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. I have read that when the end of life draws near,
everything and everybody rushes by in continuous review&mdash;Is
this the end?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Yes, it is my end. Farewell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Give us a parting word.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. No, I cannot. Do you believe that your words can
express our thoughts?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">DEAN OF THEOLOGY</span>. [<i>Enters in a rage</i>] I am cast off by God and

it is? A martyrology, a calendar with a martyr for each day of
the year.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE DAUGHTER</span>. Martyr?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Yes, one that has been tortured and killed on
account of his faith! Tell me why?&mdash;Do you think that all who
are tortured suffer, and that all who are killed feel pain?
Suffering is said to be salvation, and death a liberation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE POET</span>. Not one, I tell you.</p>

<p class="poet">
The parting hour has come, the end draws near.<br />
And now farewell, thou dreaming child of man,<br />
Thou singer, who alone knows how to live!<br />
When from thy winged flight above the earth<br />
At times thou sweepest downward to the dust,<br />
It is to touch it only, not to stay!<br />
<br />
And as I go&mdash;how, in the parting hour,<br />
As one must leave for e'er a friend, a place,<br />
The heart with longing swells for what one loves,<br />
And with regret for all wherein one failed!<br />
O, now the pangs of life in all their force<br />
I feel: I know at last the lot of man<br />
Regretfully one views what once was scorned;<br />
For sins one never sinned remorse is felt;<br />
To stay one craves, but equally to leave:<br />
As if to horses tied that pull apart,<br />
One's heart is split in twain, one's feelings rent,<br />
By indecision, contrast, and discord.<br />
<br />
Farewell! To all thy fellow-men make known<br />
That where I go I shall forget them not;<br />
And in thy name their grievance shall be placed<br />
Before the throne. Farewell!<br />

<p><i>A court-room. Door and windows in the background. Through the
windows are seen the churchyard and the bell-tower. Door on the
right. On the left, the desk of the judge on a platform. The
front side of the desk is decorated in gold, with the judicial
emblems of the sword and the scales. On both sides of the desk
are placed chairs and small tables for the twelve jurors. In the
centre of the room, benches for the spectators. Along the sides
of the room are cupboards built into the walls. On the doors of
these are posted court notices and schedules of market tolls</i>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p style="text-align: center;">SCENE I</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<blockquote><p><span class="small-c">THE SHERIFF</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">THE CONSTABLE</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">THE SHERIFF</span>. Did you ever see such a lot of people at the summer
sessions before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">THE CONSTABLE</span>. Not in fifteen years, or since we had the big
murder at Alder Lake.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Well, this story here is almost as good as a double
parricide. That the Baron and the Baroness are going to separate
is scandal enough, but when on top of it the families take to
wrangling about properties and estates, then it's easy to see
that there's going to be a hot time. The only thing wanting now
is that they get to fighting over the child, too, and then King
Solomon himself can't tell what's right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. What is there behind this case anyhow? Some say this
and some say that, but the blame ought to rest on somebody?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. I don't know about that. Sometimes it is nobody's
fault when two quarrel, and then again one alone is to blame
for the quarrel of two. Now take my old shrew, for instance,
she's running around at home scolding for dear life all by
herself when I am away, they tell me. Besides, this is not just
a quarrel, but a full-fledged criminal case, and in most such
one party is complainant, or the one that has been wronged, and
the other is defendant, or the one that has committed the crime.
But in this case it is not easy to tell who is guilty, for both
parties are at once complainants and defendants.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. Well, well, queer things do happen these days. It's
as if the women had gone crazy. My old one has spells when she
says that I should bear children also, if there was any justice
in things&mdash;just as if the Lord didn't know how he made his own
creatures. And then I get long rigmaroles about her being human
also, just as if I didn't know that before, or had said anything
to the contrary; and of her being tired of acting as my servant
girl, when, for a fact, I am not much better than her hired man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. So-o. So you have got that kind of plague in your house
too. Mine reads a paper she gets at the manor, and then she
tells me as something wonderful, one day, that some farmer's
lass has turned mason, and the next that an old woman has set
upon and beaten her sick husband. I cannot quite get at what's
the meaning of it all, but it looks most as if she was mad at me
for being a man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. Mighty queer, that's what it is. [<i>Offers snuff</i>]
Fine weather we're having. The rye is standing as thick as the
hairs in a fox fell, and we got over the black frosts without a
hitch.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. There is nothing of mine growing, and good years are
bad for me: no executions and no auctions. Do you know anything
about the new judge who is going to hold court to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. Not much, but I understand he's a youngster who has
just got his appointment and is going to sit for the first time
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. And they say he is religious. Hm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. Hm-hm!&mdash;They're taking an awful time over the church
services this year.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Puts a big Bible on the judge's desk and a smaller
one on each one of the jurors' tables</i>] It cannot be long till
they're done now, for they have been at it most of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. He's a wonder at preaching, is the Pastor, once he
gets going. [<i>Pause</i>] Are the parties to put in a personal
appearance?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Both of them, so I guess we'll have some scrapping&mdash;
[<i>The bell in the tower begins to ring</i>] There, now they're
done&mdash;Just give the tables a wiping, and I think we are ready to
start.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. And there's ink in all the wells?</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<p style="text-align: center;">SCENE II</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<blockquote><p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARON</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>enter</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. [<i>In a low voice to the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>] Then, before we part
for a year, we are perfectly agreed on all points. First, no
recriminations in court?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Do you think I would care to lay open the intimate
details of our common life before a lot of curious peasants?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. So much the better! And further: you keep the child
during the year of separation, provided it may visit me when I
so desire, and provided it is educated in accordance with the
principles laid down by me and approved by you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Exactly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. And out of the income from the estate I give you three
thousand crowns during the year of separation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Agreed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Then I have nothing more to add, but ask only to bid you
good-bye. Why we part is known only to you and me, and for the
sake of our son no one else must know it. But for his sake I beg
you also: start no fight, lest we be goaded into soiling the
names of his parents. It is more than likely, anyhow, that life
in its cruelty will make him suffer for our divorce.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I don't care to fight as long as I may keep my child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Let us then concentrate our attention on the child's
welfare and forget what has happened between us. And remember
another thing: if we fight about the child and question each
other's fitness to take care of it, the judge may take it away
from both of us and put it with some of those religious people
who will bring it up in hatred and contempt for its parents.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That's impossible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Such, my dear, is the law.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. It is a stupid law.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Maybe, but it holds; and for you no less than for others.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. It is unnatural! And I should never submit to it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. You don't have to, as we have decided to raise no
objections against each other. We have never agreed before, but
on this one point we are at one, are we not: to part without
any kind of hostility? [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>] Could the Baroness be
permitted to wait in that room over there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Certainly, walk right in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARON</span> <i>escorts the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>to the door on
the right and leaves then himself through the door in

<p style="text-align: center;">SCENE III</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. <i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span>. <i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. <span class="small-c">ALMA
JONSSON</span>. <i>The</i> <span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span>. <i>The</i> <span class="small-c">FARM HAND</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALMA JONSSON</span>] Look here, my girl: that you have
stolen, I don't doubt for a moment; but as your master has no
witnesses to it, you are not guilty. But as your master has
called you a thief in the presence of two witnesses, he is
guilty of slander. And now you are complainant and he defendant.
Remember this one thing: the first duty of a criminal is&mdash;to
deny!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALMA JONSSON</span>. But please, sir, didn't you just say I was no
criminal, and master was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. You are a criminal because you have committed a theft,
but as you have called for a lawyer, it is my unmistakable duty
to clear you and convict your master. Therefore, and for the
last time: deny! [<i>To the witnesses</i>] And as to the witnesses,
what are they going to testify? Listen: a good witness sticks
to the case. Now you must bear in mind that the question is
not whether Alma has stolen anything or not, but only whether
Alexandersson said that she had stolen. For, mark you, he has
no right to prove his assertions, but we have. Why it should
be so, the devil only knows! But that's none of your business.
Therefore: keep your tongues straight and your fingers on the
Bible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">MILKMAID</span>. Lord, but I'm that scared, for I don't know what I'm
going to say!</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">PASTOR</span> <i>enter</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Permit me to thank you for the sermon, Pastor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Oh, don't mention it, Judge.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes&mdash;for, as you know, this is my first court. To tell
the truth, I have felt some fear of this career, into which I
have been thrown almost against my will. For one thing, the laws
are so imperfect, the judicial practices so uncertain, and human
nature so full of falsehood and dissimulation, that I have often
wondered how a judge could dare to express any definite opinion
at all. And to-day you have revived all my old fears.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. To be conscientious is a duty, of course, but to be
sentimental about it won't do. And as everything else on this
earth is imperfect, there is no reason why we should expect
judges and judgments to be perfect.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. That may be, but it does not prevent me from harbouring
a sense of tremendous responsibility, as I have men's fates in
my hand, and a word spoken by me may show its effects through
generations. I am especially thinking of this separation suit
started by the Baron and his wife, and I have to ask you&mdash;you
who have administered the two prescribed warnings before
the Vestry Board&mdash;what is your view concerning their mutual
relations and relative guilt?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. In other words, Judge, you would either put me in your
own place or base your decision on my testimony. And all I can
do is to refer you to the minutes of the board.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Yes, the minutes&mdash;I know them. But it is just what does
not appear in the minutes that I need to know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. What charges the couple made against each other at the
private hearings must be my secret. And besides, how can I know
who told the truth and who lied? I have to tell you what I told
them: there is no reason why I should believe more in one than
in the other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But were you not able to form some kind of opinion in the
matter during the hearings?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. When I heard one, I formed one opinion, and another when
I was hearing the other. In a word: I have no settled view in
this question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But I am to express a definite view&mdash;I, who know nothing
at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. That is the heavy task of the judge, which I could never
undertake.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But there are witnesses to be heard? Evidence to be
obtained?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. No, they are not accusing each other in public. And
furthermore: two false witnesses will furnish sufficient proof,
and a perjurer will do just as well. Do you think I would base
my judgment on servant gossip, on the loose-tongued chatter of
envious neighbours, or on the spiteful partisanship of relatives?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. You are a terrible sceptic, Pastor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Well, one gets to be so after sixty, and particularly
after having tended souls for forty years. The habit of lying
clings like original sin, and I believe that all men lie. As
children we lie out of fear; as grown-ups, out of interest,
need, instinct for self-preservation; and I have known those who
lied out of sheer kindliness. In the present case, and in so
far as this married couple is concerned, I fear you will find
it very hard to figure out who has told most of the truth, and
all I can do is to warn you against being caught in the snares
set by preconceived opinions. You were married not long ago
yourself, and you are still under the spell of the young woman's
witchery. For this reason you may easily become prejudiced in
favor of a young and charming lady, who is an unhappy wife and
a mother besides. On the other hand, you have also recently
become a father, and as such you cannot escape being moved by
the impending separation of the father from his child. Beware of
sympathy with either side, for sympathy with one is cruelty to
the other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. One thing will make my task more easy at least, and that
is their mutual agreement on the principal points.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Don't rely too much on that, for it is what they all
say. And when they appear in court, the smouldering fire breaks
into open flames. In this case a tiny spark will be enough to
start a conflagration. Here comes the jury. Well, good-by for a
while! I stay, although I shall not be seen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>, [<i>Calls out</i>] The servant girl Alma Jonsson and the
farmer Alexandersson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. I wish to present my power of attorney for the
complainant.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Examines the submitted document; then</i>] The servant
girl Alma Jonsson has had writ served on her former master,
Alexandersson, bringing charges under Chapter Sixteen, Section
Eight, of the Criminal Code, providing for imprisonment of not
more than six months, or a fine, because Alexandersson has
called her a thief without supporting his accusation or making
legal charges. What have you to say, Alexandersson?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. I called her a thief because I caught her
stealing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Have you witnesses to her theft?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. No, as luck would have it, there's no witnesses,
for I mostly go about by myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Why did you not make a charge against her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. Well, I never go to court. And then it isn't the
usage among us masters to prosecute household thefts, partly
because there are so many of 'em, and partly because we don't
like to spoil a servant's whole future.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Alma Jonsson, what have you to say in answer to this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALMA JONSSON</span>. Ya-es&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. You keep quiet! Alma Jonsson, who is not a defendant
in this case, but the complainant, asks to have her witnesses
heard in order that she may prove the slander uttered against
her by Alexandersson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As Alexandersson has admitted the slander, I shall ask
for no witnesses. On the other hand, it is of importance for me
to know whether Alma Jonsson be guilty of the offence mentioned,
for if Alexandersson had reasonable grounds for his utterance,
this will be held a mitigating circumstance when sentence is
passed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. I must take exception to the statement made by the
Court, for by Chapter Sixteen, Section Thirteen, of the Criminal
Code, one charged with slander is denied the right to bring
evidence as to the truth of his defamation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Parties, witnesses, and spectators will retire so that
the Court may consider the case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <span class="small-c">COURT</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Is Alexandersson an honest and reliable man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL THE JURORS</span>. Alexandersson is a reliable man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Is Alma Jonsson known as an honest servant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC OTTO BOMAN</span>. I had to discharge Alma Jonsson last year for
petty thievery.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And nevertheless I have now to fine Alexandersson. There
is no way out of it. Is he poor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LUDWIG ÖSTMAN</span>. He's behind with his Crown taxes, and his crop
failed last year. So I guess the fine will be more than he can
carry.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And yet I can find no reason to postpone the case, as
it is a clear one, and Alexandersson has no right to prove
anything on his side. Has any one here anything to add or object?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDER EKLUND</span>. I would just ask leave to make a general
reflection. A case like this, where one not only innocent, but
offended against, has to take the punishment, while the thief
has his so-called honour restored, may easily bring about that
people grow less forbearing toward their fellow-men, and that
taking cases to court grows more common.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. This is quite possible, but general reflections have no
place in the proceedings, and the Court has to make a decision.
Consequently my one question to the jury is: can Alexandersson
be held guilty under Chapter Sixteen, Section Thirteen, of the
Criminal Code?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL THE JURORS</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LAWYER</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALMA JONSSON</span>] What did I tell you! If you only

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARON</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>enter after awhile</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>] Call the separation suit of Baron
Sprengel and his wife, born Malmberg.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Separation suit of Baron Sprengel and his wife, born
Malmberg.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARON</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>enter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. In the proceedings entered against his wife, Baron
Sprengel declares his intention of not continuing the marriage,
and requests that, as the warnings of the Vestry Board have
proved fruitless, order be issued for a year's separation in bed
and board. What objection have you to make to this, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. To the separation I make no objection at all; if I can
only have my child. That is my condition.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The law recognises no conditions in a case like this, and
it is for the Court to dispose of the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Why, that's very peculiar!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. For this reason it is of utmost importance that the
Court learn who has caused the dissension leading to this suit.
According to appended minutes of the Vestry Board, it appears
that the wife has admitted having at times shown a quarrelsome
and difficult disposition, while the husband has admitted no
fault. Thus, Baroness, you appear to have admitted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That's a lie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I find it difficult to believe that the minutes of the
Vestry Board, countersigned by the Pastor and eight other
trustworthy men, can be inaccurate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. The report is false!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Such remarks cannot be made with impunity before this
Court.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. May I call attention to the fact that I have voluntarily
surrendered the child to the Baroness on certain conditions?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And I have to repeat once more what I said before,
namely, that the case will be decided by the Court and not
by the parties to it. Therefore: you deny having caused any
dissension, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Indeed, I do! And it is not the fault of one that two
quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. This is no quarrel, Baroness, but a criminal case;
and furthermore, you seem now to be displaying a contentious
temperament as well as inconsiderate behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Then you don't know my husband.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Will you please explain yourself, for I can base no
decision on mere insinuations.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Then I must ask to have the case dismissed, so that I can
obtain separation in other ways.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The case is already before the Court and will have to be
carried to its conclusion&mdash;Baroness, you maintain then that your
husband has caused the estrangement. Can this be proved?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, it can be proved.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Please do so then, but bear in mind that it is a question
of depriving the Baron of his parental rights and also of his
rights to the property.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. He has forfeited it many times over, and not the least
when he denied me sleep and food.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I feel compelled to state that I have never refused to
let the Baroness sleep. I have merely asked her not to sleep
in the afternoon, because thereby the house was neglected and
the child left without proper care. As to food, I have always
left such matters to my wife, and I have only objected to some
extravagant entertainments, as the neglected household could not
bear such expenses.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. And he has let me lie sick without calling in a
physician.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. The Baroness would always be taken sick when she could
not have her own way, but that kind of ailment did not last long
as a rule. After I had brought a specialist from the city, and
he had declared it to be nothing but tricks, I did not judge it
necessary to call a physician the next time the Baroness was
taken sick&mdash;because the new pier-glass cost fifty crowns less
than originally intended.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. All this is not of such nature that it can be considered
when such a serious case has to be decided. There must be some
deeper motives.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. It ought to be counted a motive that the father will
not permit the mother to bring up her own child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. First of all, the Baroness left the care of the child to
a maid, and whenever she tried to assist, things went wrong.
Secondly, she tried to bring up the boy as a woman, and not as a
man. For instance, she dressed him as a girl until he was four
years old; and to this very day, when he is eight years old, he
carries his hair long as a girl, is forced to sew and crochet,
and plays with dolls; all of which I regard as injurious to the
child's normal development into a man. On the other hand, she
has amused herself by dressing up the daughters of our tenants
as boys, cutting their hair short, and putting them to work on
things generally handled by boys. In a word, I took charge of my
son's education because I noticed symptoms of mental derangement
which before this have led to offences against the Eighteenth
Chapter of the Criminal Code.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And yet you are now willing to leave the child in the
hands of the mother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, for I have never been able to contemplate such a
cruelty as to separate mother and child&mdash;and also because the
mother has promised to mend her ways. And for that matter, I had
only promised conditionally, and with the understanding that
the law was not to be invoked in the matter. But since we have
not been able to keep away from recriminations, I have changed
my mind&mdash;especially as, from being the complainant, I have been
turned into a defendant.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That's the way this man always keeps his promises.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. My promises, like those of other people, have always been
conditional, and I have kept them as long as the conditions were
observed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. In the same way he had promised me personal freedom
within the marriage.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Naturally with the provision that the laws of decency
were kept inviolate; but when all bounds were exceeded, and
when ideas of license appeared under the name of freedom, then I
regarded my promise as annulled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. And for this reason he tormented me with the most
absurd jealousy, and that is generally enough to make a common
life unbearable. He even made himself ridiculous to the extent
of being jealous of the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. This alleged jealousy may be reduced to an advice on my
part against the employment of a notorious and tattling masseur
for an ailment commonly treated by women&mdash;unless the Baroness is
having in mind the occasion when I showed our steward the door
for smoking in my drawing-room and offering cigars to my wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. AS we have not been able to keep away from
scandal-mongering, it is just as well that the whole truth
should get out: the Baron has been guilty of adultery. Is not
this enough to make him unworthy of bringing up my child alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Can you prove this, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, I can, and here are letters that show.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>Receiving the letters</i>] How long ago did this happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. A year ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Of course, the time limit for prosecution has already
expired, but the fact itself weighs heavily against the husband
and may cause him to lose the child entirely as well as a part
of the marriage portion. Do you admit the truth of this charge,
Baron?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, with remorse and mortification; but there were
circumstances which ought to be held extenuating. I was forced
into humiliating celibacy by the calculated coldness of the
Baroness, although I, and in all courtesy, asked as a favour,
what the law allowed me to demand as a right. I tired of buying
her love, she having prostituted our marriage by selling her
favours first for power and later for presents and money; and
in the end I found myself compelled, with the express consent of
the Baroness, to take up an irregular relationship.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Had you given your consent, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. No, that is not true! I demand proofs!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. It is true, but I cannot prove it, since the only
witness, my wife, denies it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What is unproved need not be untrue, but a com-pact of
this kind, trespassing upon prevailing laws, must be held a
<i>pactum turpe</i> and invalid in itself. Baron, so far everything
is against you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. And as the Baron has confessed his guilt with remorse
and shame, I, who have now become complainant instead of
defendant, ask that the Court proceed to render a decision, as
further details are not needed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. In my capacity as presiding officer of this Court, I wish
to hear what the Baron has to say in justification, or at least
in palliation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I have just admitted the charge of adultery and have
advanced as extenuating circumstances, partly that it was the
result of pressing need when, after ten years of married life,
I suddenly found myself unmarried, and partly that it was done
with the consent of the Baroness herself. As I have now come
to believe that all this was a trap set to make a case against
me, it is my duty, for the sake of my son, to hold back no
further&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Exclaims instinctively</i>] Axel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. What caused me to break my marital vows was the
faithlessness of the Baroness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Baron, can you prove that the Baroness has been faithless
to you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. No! For I was concerned about the honour of the family,
and I destroyed all proofs that I obtained. But I still venture
to believe that, in this matter, the Baroness will stand by the
confession she once made to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Baroness, do you admit this offence as preceding and,
therefore, probably causing the lapse of the Baron?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Are you willing to repeat under oath that you are
innocent of this charge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Good heavens! No, she must not do that! No perjury for my
sake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. I ask once more: is the Baroness willing to take the oath?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Permit me to suggest that the Baroness just now appears
as complainant, and a complaint is not made under oath.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As you have charged her with a criminal offence, she is
defendant. What does the Jury hold?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">EMMANUEL WICKBERG</span>. As the Baroness is a party to this suit, it
seems to me that she can hardly be allowed to testify in her own
behalf.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SWEN OSCAR ERLIN</span>. It seems to me that if the Baroness is to
testify under oath, then the Baron should also be allowed to do
so in the same matter, but as oath may not be put against oath,
the whole matter remains in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AUGUST ALEXANDER VASS</span>. I should say that it is not a question of
testifying under oath here, but of taking an oath on one's own
innocence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS ERIC RUTH</span>. Well, isn't that the question which has to be
settled first of all?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL WALLIN</span>. But not in the presence of the parties, as the
deliberations of the Court are not public.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CARL JOHAN SJÖBERG</span>. The right of the jury to express itself is
not limited or conditioned by secrecy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Out of so many meanings I can get no guidance. But as the
guilt of the Baron can be proved, and that of the Baroness still
remains unproved, I must demand that the Baroness take oath on
her innocence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I am ready!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. No, wait a moment!&mdash;Baron, if you were granted time,
would you be able to produce evidence or witnesses in support of
your charge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. This I neither can nor will do, as I am not anxious to
see my dishonour made public.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The proceedings of the Court will be adjourned while I
consult with the chairman of the Vestry Board.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>] You do not shrink from perjuring
yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I shrink from nothing when my child is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. But if I have proofs?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Well, you have not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. The letters were burned, but certified copies of them are
still in existence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You lie to frighten me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. To show you how deeply I love my child, and to save the
mother at least, as I seem to be lost, you&mdash;may have the proofs.
But don't be ungrateful.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Hands her a bundle of letters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That you are a liar, I knew before, but that you were
scoundrel enough to have the letters copied, that I could never
have believed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. That is your thanks! But now both of us are lost.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, let both go down&mdash;then there will be an end to
the fight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Is it better for the child to lose both its parents and
be left alone in the world?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That will never occur!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Your absurd conceit, which makes you think yourself
above all laws and above other human beings, has lured you into
starting this fight, in which there can be only one loser: our
son! What were you thinking of when you began this attack,
which could not fail to provoke a defence? Not of the child, I
am sure. But of revenge, I suppose? Revenge for what? For my
discovery of your guilt?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. The child? Were you thinking of the child when you
dragged me in the mire before this rabble?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Helen!&mdash;Like wild beasts we have clawed each other
bloody. We have laid our disgrace open to all these who take
pleasure in our ruin, for in this room we have not a single
friend. Our child will after this never be able to speak of his
parents as respectable people; he will not be able to start life
with a recommendation from father and mother; he will see the
home shunned, the old parents isolated and despised, and so the
time must come when he will flee us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. What do you want then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Let us leave the country after selling the property.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. And begin the same squabble all over again! I know
what will happen: for a week you will be tame, and then you will
abuse me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Just think&mdash;now they are settling our fate in there.
You cannot hope for a good word from the Pastor, whom you have
just called a liar; and I, who am known to be no Christian, can
expect no mercy either. Oh, I wish I were in the woods, so that
I could crawl in under some big roots or put my head under a
rock&mdash;this is more shame than I can bear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. It is true that the minister hates both of us, and it
may happen as you say. Why don't you speak to him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Of what? Making up?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Of anything you please, if it only be not too late!
Oh, if it should be too late!&mdash;What can that man Alexandersson
want that makes him prowl about us two all the time? I am afraid
of that man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Alexandersson is a nice fellow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, he is nice to you, but not to me&mdash;I have observed
those glances before&mdash;Go and see the Pastor now; but take my
hand first&mdash;I am scared!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Of what, dear, of what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I don't know&mdash;Everything, everybody!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. But not of me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. No, not now! It is as if our clothes had been caught
in the mill wheels, and we had been dragged into the machinery.
What have we been doing? What have we been doing in our anger?
How they will enjoy themselves, all these who are now seeing
the Baron and the Baroness stripped naked and flogging each
other&mdash;Oh, I feel as if I were standing here without a rag to
cover me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She buttons her coat</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Calm yourself, my dear. It is not exactly the proper
place to tell you what I have said before: that there is only
one friend and one home&mdash;but we might start over again!&mdash;Well,
heaven knows! No, we cannot do it. You have gone too far. It is
all over. And this last&mdash;yes, let it be the last! And it had
to come after all the rest. No, we are enemies for life! And
if I let you go away with the child now, then you might marry
again&mdash;I see that now. And my child might have a step-father;
and I should have to watch another man going about with my wife
and child&mdash;Or I might myself be going about with somebody else's
wench hanging on my arm. No! Either you or I! One of us must be
struck down! You or I!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You! For if I let you take the child, you might marry
again, and I might have to see another woman taking my place
with my own child. The mere thought of it could make me a
murderess! A step-mother for <i>my</i> child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. You might have thought of it before! But when you saw me
champing at the chain of love that bound me to you, then you
believed me incapable of loving anybody but yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Do you think I ever loved you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, once at least. When I had been faithless to you.
Then your love grew sublime. And your pretended scorn made
you irresistible. But my error caused you to respect me, too.
Whether it was the male or the criminal you admired most, I
don't know, but I believe it was both&mdash;it must have been both,
for you are the most typical woman I have ever met. And now you
are already jealous of a new wife whom I have never thought
of. What a pity that you became my mate! As my mistress, your
victory would have been unchallenged, and your infidelities
would only have seemed the bouquet of my new wine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, your love was always material.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Material as everything spiritual, and spiritual as all
that is material! My weakness for you, which gave strength to
my feeling, made you believe yourself the stronger, when you
were simply coarser, more ill-natured, and more unscrupulous
than I.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You the stronger? You, who never want the same thing
two minutes in a stretch! You, who as a rule never know what you
want!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, I know perfectly well what I want, but there is room
in me for both love and hatred, and while I love you one minute,
I hate you the next. And just now I hate you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Are you now thinking of the child also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, now and always! And do you know why? Because he is
our love that has taken flesh. He is the memory of our beautiful
hours, the link that unites our souls, the common ground where
we must ever meet without wishing to do so. And that is why
we shall never be able to part, even if our separation be
declared&mdash;Oh, if I could only hate you as I want to!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">PASTOR</span> <i>enter in conversation
and remain in the foreground</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Thus I recognize the utter hopelessness of seeking
justice or discovering truth. And it seems to me as if the laws
were a couple of centuries behind our ideas of right. Did I not
have to punish Alexandersson, who was innocent, and exonerate
the girl, who was guilty of theft? And as for this separation
suit, I know nothing at all about it at this minute, and I
cannot take upon my conscience to render a decision.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. But a decision has to be rendered.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Not by me! I shall give up my place and choose another
profession.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Why, such a scandal would only bring you notoriety and
close every career to you. Keep on judging a few years, and you
will come to think it quite easy to crush human fates like egg
shells. And for that matter, if you want to stand clear of this
case, let yourself be outvoted by the jury. Then they must take
the responsibility on themselves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. That is a way&mdash;and I suspect that they will be
practically at one against me, for I have formed an opinion in
this matter, which, however, is wholly intuitive and, therefore,
not to be trusted&mdash;I thank you for your advice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. [<i>Who has been talking with</i> Alexandersson, <i>steps up
to the</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>] In my capacity of public prosecutor, I have to
report the farmer Alexandersson as a witness against Baroness
Sprengel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. In relation to the adultery charge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>] Here is a new clue that may lead to a
solution.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Oh, there are lots of clues, if you can only get hold of
them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. But nevertheless it is horrible to see two persons who
have loved trying to ruin each other. It is like being in a
slaughter-house!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. Well, that is love, Judge!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. What then is hatred?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. It is the lining of the coat.</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">JUDGE</span> <i>goes over and speaks to the</i> <span class="small-c">JURORS</span>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. [<i>Comes forward to the</i> <span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>] Help us, Pastor! Help
us!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">PASTOR</span>. I cannot, and as a clergyman, I must not. And
furthermore, did I not warn you not to play with such serious
matters? You thought it so simple to part! Well, part then! The
law will not prevent you, so don't put the blame on it. </p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p style="text-align: center;">SCENE XII</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL</span> <i>as before</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. The Court will now resume its proceedings. According
to the report of the public prosecutor, Sheriff Wiberg, a new
witness has appeared against the Baroness and is ready to affirm
her guilt under the charge of adultery. Farmer Alexandersson!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. I am here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. How can you prove your assertion?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. I saw the offence committed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. He is lying! Let him bring proof!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. Proof? I'm a witness now, ain't I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Your assertion is no proof, although you happen to be
called a witness for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. Maybe the witness has to have two more witnesses,
and those still others?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Yes, it might be needed when one cannot tell whether
the whole lot are lying or not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. The testimony of Alexandersson will not be required. I
beg leave to offer the Court all the correspondence by which
the marital infidelity of the Baroness stands completely
proved&mdash;Here are the originals; copies of them will be found in
the possession of defendant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>utters a cry but controls herself
quickly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. And yet, Baroness, you were willing to take the oath a
little while ago?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. But I didn't take it! And now I think the Baron and I
may cry quits.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. We do not let one crime cancel another. The account of
each one has to be settled separately.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Then I want to file a claim at once against the Baron
for my dowry which he has squandered.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. If you have squandered your wife's dowry, Baron, it might
be well to settle that matter right here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. The Baroness brought with her six thousand crowns in
stock that was then unsalable and soon became wholly worthless.
As at the time of our marriage she held a position as a
telegrapher and declared herself unwilling to take support from
her husband, we made a marriage contract and agreed that each
one should be self-supporting. But she lost her position after
the marriage, and I have been supporting her ever since. To this
I had no objection whatever, but as she is now putting in bills,
I shall ask leave to present one of my own to meet hers. It
totals up to thirty-five thousand crowns, this being one-third
of the household expenses since the beginning of our marriage,
and I being willing to take two-thirds upon myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Have you this agreement in black and white, Baron?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I have not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Have you any documents to prove the disposition of your
dowry, Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I didn't think at the time it would be necessary to
get anything in writing, as I supposed myself to be dealing with
honourable people.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Then this whole question cannot come under consideration
here. The jury will please step into the small court-room for
discussion of the case and formulation of a decision. </p>

I can get any sense out of.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. I think it would be wiser for you to go right home
now, or you might have the same experience as the farmer from
Mariestad. Did you ever hear of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. Well, he went to court as spectator, was dragged into
the case as witness, became a party to it, and ended up with a
flogging at the whipping-post.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDERSSON</span>. Oh, hell! But I believe it of 'em! I believe
anything of 'em! [<i>Goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARON</span> <i>joins the</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>in the foreground</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You find it hard to keep away from me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Now I have struck you down, and I am bleeding to death
myself, for your blood is mine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. And how clever you are at making out bills!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Only when it comes to counter-claims! Your courage is
that of despair, or that of a person sentenced to death. And
when you leave here, you will collapse. Then you will no longer
be able to load your sorrow and guilt on me, and you will be
suffering from remorse. Do you know why I have not killed you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Because you did not dare!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. No! Not even the thought of hell could have held me
back&mdash;for I don't believe in it. But this was the thought that
did it: even if you get the child, you will be gone in five
years. That is what the doctor tells me. And then the child
might be left without either father or mother. Think of it&mdash;all
alone in the world!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Five years!&mdash;It is a lie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. In five years! And then I am left behind with the child
whether you want it or not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Oh no! For then my family will bring suit to get the
child away from you. I don't die when I die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Evil never dies! That is so! But can you explain why you
grudge me the child, and grudge the child me, whom it needs?
Is it sheer malice&mdash;a craving for revenge that punishes the
child? [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>remains silent</i>] Do you know, I remarked
to the Pastor that I thought possibly you might have some
doubts concerning the child's parentage, and that this might
be a reason why you would not let me have the child, lest my
happiness be built on a false foundation. And he replied: No,
I don't think her capable of it&mdash;not of such a fine motive&mdash;I
don't think you know yourself what makes you so fanatical about
this one thing: it is the yearning for continued existence that
goads you into maintaining your hold. Our son has your body, but
my soul, and that soul you cannot rid him of. In him you will
have me back when you least expect it; in him you will find my
thoughts, my tastes, my passions, and for this reason you will
hate him one day, as you hate me now. That is what I fear!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You seem still a little afraid that he may become mine?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. In your quality of mother and woman, you have a certain
advantage over me with our judges, and although justice may
throw dice blindfolded, there is always a little lead on one
side of each die.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You know how to pay compliments even in the moment of
separation. Perhaps you don't hate me as much as you pretend?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Frankly speaking, I think that I hate not so much you as
my dishonour, though you, too, come in for a share. And why this
hatred? Perhaps I have overlooked that you are near the forties,
and that a masculine element is making its appearance in you.
Perhaps it is this element that I notice in your kisses, in your
embraces&mdash;perhaps that is what I find so repulsive?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Perhaps. For the sorrow of my life has been, as you
well know, that I was not born a man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Perhaps that became the sorrow of my life! And now you
try to avenge yourself on nature for having played with you, and
so you want to bring up your son as a woman. Will you promise me
one thing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Will you promise me one thing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. What is the use of promising?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. No, let us give no more promises.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Will you answer a question truthfully?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. If I told the truth, you would think I lied.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, so I should!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Can you see now that all is over, for ever?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. For ever! It was for ever that we once swore to love each
other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. It is too bad that such oaths must be taken!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Why so? It is always a bond, such as it is.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I never could bear with bonds!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Do you think it would have been better for us not to bind
ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Better for me, yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I wonder. For then you could not have bound me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Nor you me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. And so the result would have been the same&mdash;as when
you reduce fractions. Consequently: not the law's fault; not
our own; not anybody else's. And yet we have to assume the
responsibility! [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span> <i>approaches</i>] So! Now the verdict
has been pronounced&mdash;Good-bye, Helen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Good-bye&mdash;Axel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. It is hard to part! And impossible to live together. But
the fight is over at least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. If it were! I fear it is just about to begin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>. The parties will retire while the Court takes action.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Axel, a word before it is too late! After all, they
might take the child away from both of us. Drive home and take
the boy to your mother, and then we will flee from here, far
away!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I think you are trying to fool me again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. No, I am not. I am no longer thinking of you, or of
myself, or of my revenge. Save the child only! Listen, Axel&mdash;you
must do it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. I will. But if you are deceiving me&mdash;Never mind: I'll do
it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. As we now have the case complete before us, I shall ask
each juror separately to state his opinion before decision is
rendered. Personally, I can only hold it reasonable that the
child be given to the mother, as both parties are equally to
blame for the estrangement, and as the mother must be held
better adapted to the care of the child than the father.
[<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALEXANDER EKLUND</span>. According to prevailing law, it is the wife
who takes her rank and condition from the husband, not the
husband from the wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">EMMANUEL WICKBERG</span>. And the husband is the proper guardian of his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CARL JOHAN SJÖBERG</span>. The ritual, which gives binding force to the
marriage, says that the wife should obey her husband, and so it
is clear to me that the man takes precedence of the woman.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ERIC OTTO BOMAN</span>. And the children are to be brought up in the
faith of the father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ÄRENFRID SÖDERBERG</span>. From which may be concluded that children
follow the father and not the mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLOF ANDERSSON OF WIK</span>. But as in the case before us both man and
wife are equally guilty, and, judging by what has come to light,
equally unfit to rear a child, I hold that the child should be
taken away from both.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CARL PETER ANDERSSON OF BERGA</span>. In concurring with Olof
Andersson, I may call to mind that in such cases the Court
names two good men as guardians to take charge of children and
property, so that out of the latter man and wife may have their
support together with the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AXEL WALLIN</span>. And for guardians I wish in this case to propose
Alexander Eklund and Ärenfrid Söderberg, both of whom are well
known to be of honest character and Christian disposition.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ANDERS ERIC RUTH</span>. I concur with Olof Andersson of Wik as to the
separation of the child from both father and mother, and with
Axel Wallin as to the guardians, whose Christian disposition
makes them particularly fitted to bring up the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">SWEN OSCAR ERLING</span>. I concur in what has just been said.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">AUGUST ALEXANDER VASS</span>. I concur.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LUDWIG ÖSTMAN</span>. I concur.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. AS the opinion expressed by a majority of the jurors is
contrary to my own, I must ask the Jury to take a vote on the
matter. And I think it proper first to put the motion made by
Olof Andersson for the separation of the child from both father
and mother, and for the appointment of guardians. Is it the
unanimous will of the Jury that such action be taken?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALL THE JURORS</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. If anybody objects to the motion, he will hold up his
hand. [<i>Silence</i>] The opinion of the Jury has won out against my
own, and I shall enter an exception on the minutes against what
seems to me the needless cruelty of the decision&mdash;The couple
will then be sentenced to a year's separation of bed and board,
at the risk of imprisonment if, during that period, they should
seek each other. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span>] Call in the parties.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">SPECTATORS</span> <i>enter</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Is Baron Sprengel not present?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. The Baron will be here in a moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Whoever does not observe the time, has only himself to
blame. This is the decision of the County Court: that husband
and wife be sentenced to a year's separation of bed and board,
and that the child be taken from the parents and placed in
charge of two guardians for education. For this purpose the
Court has selected and appointed the jurors Alexander Eklund and
Ärenfrid Söderberg.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">BARONESS</span> <i>cries out and sinks to the floor.
The</i> <span class="small-c">SHERIFF</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">CONSTABLE</span> <i>raise her up and
place her on a chair. Some of the</i> <span class="small-c">SPECTATORS</span> <i>leave
in the meantime</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Your Honor! I heard the sentence of the
Court from the outside, and I wish to enter a challenge, first
against the Jury as a whole, it being made up of my personal
enemies, and secondly against the guardians, Alexander Eklund
and Ärenfrid Söderberg, neither of whom possesses the financial
status demanded of guardians. Furthermore, I shall enter
proceedings against the judge for incompetence displayed in the
exercise of his office, in so far as he has failed to recognise
that the primary guilt of one led to the subsequent guilt of the
other, so that both cannot be held equally responsible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDGE</span>. Whosoever be not satisfied with the decision rendered may
appeal to the higher court within the term set by law. Will the
Jury please accompany me on house visitation to the Rectory in
connection with the suit pending against the communal assessors?</p>

<i>withdraw gradually</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Where is Emil?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. He was gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. That's a lie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. [<i>After a pause</i>] Yes&mdash;I did not bring him to my mother,
whom I cannot trust, but to the Rectory.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. To the minister!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Your one reliable enemy! Yes. Who was there else that I
might trust? And I did it because a while ago I caught a glance
in your eye which made me think that you possibly might kill
yourself and the child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. You saw that!&mdash;Oh, why did I let myself be fooled into
believing you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Well, what do you say of all this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I don't know. But I am so tired that I no longer feel
the blows. It seems almost a relief to have received the final
stab.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. You give no thought to what is now going to happen:
how your son is going to be brought up by two peasants, whose
ignorance and rude habits will kill the child by slow torture;
how he is going to be forced down into their narrow sphere;
how his intelligence is going to be smothered by religious
superstition; how he is going to be taught contempt for his
father and mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Hush! Don't say another word, or I shall lose my
reason! My Emil in the hands of peasant women, who don't know
enough to wash themselves, who have their beds full of vermin,
and who cannot even keep a comb clean! My Emil! No, it is
impossible!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. It is the actual reality, and you have nobody but
yourself to blame for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. Myself? But did I make myself? Did I put evil
tendencies, hatred, and wild passions into myself? No! And who
was it that denied me the power and will to combat all those
things?&mdash;When I look at myself this moment, I feel that I am to
be pitied. Am I not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. Yes, you are! Both of us are to be pitied. We tried to
avoid the rocks that beset marriage by living unmarried as
husband and wife; but nevertheless we quarrelled, and we were
sacrificing one of life's greatest joys, the respect of our
fellow-men&mdash;and so we were married. But we must needs steal a
march on the social body and its laws. We wanted no religious
ceremony, but instead we wriggled into a civil marriage. We did
not want to depend on each other&mdash;we were to have no common
pocket-book and to insist on no personal ownership of each
other&mdash;and with that we fell right back into the old rut again.
Without wedding ceremony, but with a marriage contract! And
then it went to pieces. I forgave your faithlessness, and for
the child's sake we lived together in voluntary separation&mdash;and
freedom! But I grew tired of introducing my friend's mistress as
my wife&mdash;and so we had to get a divorce. Can you guess&mdash;do you
know against whom we have been fighting? You call him God, but I
call him nature. And that was the master who egged us on to hate
each other, just as he is egging people on to love each other.
And now we are condemned to keep on tearing each other as long
as a spark of life remains. New proceedings in the higher court,
reopening of the case, report by the Vestry Board, opinion
from the Diocesan Chapter, decision by the Supreme Court. Then
comes my complaint to the Attorney-General, my application for
a guardian, your objections and counter-suits: from pillory to
post! Without hope of a merciful executioner! Neglect of the
property, financial ruin, scamped education for the child! And
why do we not put an end to these two miserable lives? Because
the child stays our hands! You cry, but I cannot! Not even when
my thought runs ahead to the night that is waiting for me in a
home laid waste! And you, poor Helen, who must go back to your
mother! That mother whom you once left with such eagerness in
order to get a home of your own. To become her daughter once
more&mdash;and perhaps find it worse than being a wife! One year! Two
years! Many years! How many more do you think we can bear to
suffer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARONESS</span>. I shall never go back to my mother. Never! I shall go
out on the high-roads and into the woods so that I may find a
hiding-place where I can scream&mdash;scream myself tired against
God, who has put this infernal love into the world as a torment
for us human creatures&mdash;and when night comes, I shall seek
shelter in the Pastor's barn, so that I may sleep near my child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">BARON</span>. You hope to sleep to-night&mdash;you?</p>

<p><i>The scene is laid inside of a round fort built of
granite</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the background, a gateway, closed by huge,
swinging double doors; in these, small square window
panes, through which may be seen a sea shore with
batteries and the sea beyond</i>.</p>

<p><i>On either side of the gateway, a window with flower
pots and bird cages</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the right of the gateway, an upright piano;
further down the stage, a sewing-table and two
easy-chairs</i>.</p>

<p><i>On the left, half-way down the stage, a
writing-table with a telegraph instrument on it;
further down, a what-not full of framed photographs.
Beside it, a couch that can be used to sleep on.
Against the wall, a buffet</i>.</p>

<p><i>A lamp suspended from the ceiling. On the wall near
the piano hang two large laurel wreaths with ribbons.
Between them, the picture of a woman in stage dress</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beside the door, a hat-stand on which hang
accoutrements, sabres, and so forth. Near it, a
chiffonier</i>.</p>

<p><i>To the left of the gateway hangs a mercurial
barometer</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is a mild Fall evening. The doors stand open, and
a sentry is seen pacing back and forth on the shore
battery. He wears a helmet with a forward pointed
brush for a crest. Now and then his drawn sabre
catches the red glare of the setting sun. The sea
lies dark and quiet</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>sits in the easy-chair to the left of
the sewing-table, fumbling an extinguished cigar. He
has on a much-worn undress uniform and riding-boots
with spurs. Looks tired and bored</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>sits in the easy-chair on the right, doing
nothing at all. Looks tired and expectant</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Won't you play something for me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Indifferently, but not snappishly</i>] What am I to play?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Whatever suits you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You don't like my repertory.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Nor you mine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Evasively</i>] Do you want the doors to stay open?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. If you wish it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Let them be, then. [<i>Pause</i>] Why don't you smoke?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Strong tobacco is beginning not to agree with me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>In an almost friendly tone</i>] Get weaker tobacco then.
It is your only pleasure, as you call it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Pleasure&mdash;what is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't ask me. I know it as little as you&mdash;Don't you want
your whiskey yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I'll wait a little. What have you for supper?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. How do I know? Ask Christine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The mackerel ought to be in season soon&mdash;now the Fall
is here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, it is Fall!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Within and without. But leaving aside the cold that
comes with the Fall, both within and without, a little broiled
mackerel, with a slice of lemon and a glass of white Burgundy,
wouldn't be so very bad.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now you grow eloquent.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have we any Burgundy left in the wine-cellar?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. So far as I know, we have had no wine-cellar these last
five years&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You never know anything. However, we <i>must</i> stock up
for our silver wedding.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you actually mean to celebrate it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Of course!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It would be more seemly to hide our misery&mdash;our
twenty-five years of misery&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. My dear Alice, it has been a misery, but we have also
had some fun&mdash;now and then. One has to avail one-self of what
little time there is, for afterward it is all over.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Is it over? Would that it were!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is over! Nothing left but what can be put on a
wheel-barrow and spread on the garden beds.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And so much trouble for the sake of the garden beds!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, that's the way of it. And it is not of my making.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. So much trouble! [<i>Pause</i>] Did the mail come?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Did the butcher send his bill?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. How large is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Takes a paper from his pocket and puts on his
spectacles, but takes them off again at once</i>] Look at it
yourself. I cannot see any longer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What is wrong with your eyes?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Growing old?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Nonsense! I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, not I!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Hm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Looking at the bill</i>] Can you pay it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, but not this moment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Some other time, of course! In a year, when you have been
retired with a small pension, and it is too late! And then, when
your trouble returns&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Trouble? I never had any trouble&mdash;only a slight
indisposition once. And I can live another twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. The doctor thought otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The doctor!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, who else could express any valid opinion about
sickness?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I have no sickness, and never had. I am not going to
have it either, for I shall die all of a sudden&mdash;like an old
soldier.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Speaking of the doctor&mdash;you know they are having a party
to-night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Agitated</i>] Yes, what of it? We are not invited
because we don't associate with those people, and we don't
associate with them because we don't want to&mdash;because we despise
both of them. Rabble&mdash;that's what they are!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You say that of everybody.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Because everybody is rabble.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Except yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, because I have behaved decently under all
conditions of life. That's why I don't belong to the rabble.</p>

<p>[<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you want to play cards?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Takes a pack of cards from the drawer in the
sewing-table and begins to shuffle them</i>] Just think, the doctor
is permitted to use the band for a private entertainment!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Angrily</i>] That's because he goes to the city and
truckles to the Colonel. Truckle, you know&mdash;if one could only do
that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Deals</i>] I used to be friendly with Gerda, but she
played me false&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. They are all false! What did you turn up for trumps?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Put on your spectacles.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. They are no help&mdash;Well, well!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Spades are trumps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Disappointed</i>] Spades&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Leads</i>] Well, be that as it may, our case is settled in
advance with the wives of the new officers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Taking the trick</i>] What does it matter? We never
give any parties anyhow, so nobody is the wiser. I can live by
myself&mdash;as I have always done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I, too. But the children? The children have to grow up
without any companionship.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Let them find it for themselves in the city&mdash;I take
that! Got any trumps left?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. One&mdash;That's mine!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Six and eight make fifteen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Fourteen&mdash;fourteen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Six and eight make fourteen. I think I am also
forgetting how to count. And two makes sixteen&mdash;[<i>Yawns</i>] It is
your deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You are tired?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Dealing</i>] Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Listening in direction of the open doors</i>] One can hear
the music all this way. [<i>Pause</i>] Do you think Curt is invited
also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. He arrived this morning, so I guess he has had time to
get out his evening clothes, though he has not had time to call
on us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Master of Quarantine&mdash;is there to be a quarantine station
here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He is my own cousin after all, and once I bore the same
name as he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. In which there was no particular honour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. See here! [<i>Sharply</i>] You leave my family alone, and I'll
leave yours!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. All right, all right&mdash;don't let us begin again!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Must the Master of Quarantine be a physician?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, no, he's merely a sort of superintendent or
book-keeper&mdash;and Curt never became anything in particular.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He was not much good&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And he has cost us a lot of money. And when he left
wife and children, he became disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Not quite so severe, Edgar!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That's what happened! What has he been doing in America
since then? Well, I cannot say that I am longing for him&mdash;but he
was a nice chap, and I liked to argue with him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Because he was so tractable&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Haughtily</i>] Tractable or not, he was at least a man
one could talk to. Here, on this island, there is not <i>one</i>
person who understands what I say&mdash;it's a community of idiots!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It is rather strange that Curt should arrive just in time
for our silver wedding&mdash;whether we celebrate it or not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Why is that strange? Oh, I see! It was he who brought
us together, or got you married, as they put it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Certainly! It was a kind of fixed idea with him&mdash;I
leave it for you to say what kind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. A wanton fancy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. For which we have had to pay, and not he!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, think only if I had remained on the stage! All my
friends are stars now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Well, well, well! Now I am going to have
a drink. [<i>Goes over to the buffet and mixes a drink, which
he takes standing up</i>] There should be a rail here to put the
foot on, so that one might dream of being at Copenhagen, in the
American Bar.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Let us put a rail there, if it will only remind us of
Copenhagen. For there we spent our best moments.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Drinks quickly</i>] Yes, do you remember that "navarin
aux pommes"?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, but I remember the concerts at the Tivoli.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, your tastes are so&mdash;exalted!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It ought to please you to have a wife whose taste is good.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. So it does.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Sometimes, when you need something to brag of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Drinking</i>] I guess they must be dancing at
the doctor's&mdash;I catch the three-four time of the tuba:
boom-boom-boom!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I can hear the entire melody of the Alcazar Waltz. Well,
it was not yesterday I danced a waltz&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You think you could still manage?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Still?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Ye-es. I guess you are done with dancing, you like me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I am ten years younger than you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Then we are of the same age, as the lady should be ten
years younger.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Be ashamed of yourself! You are an old man&mdash;and I am
still in my best years.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, I know, you can be quite charming&mdash;to others, when
you make up your mind to it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Can we light the lamp now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Will you ring, please.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>goes languidly to the writing-table

<p><span class="small-c">JENNY</span> <i>enters from the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Will you be kind enough to light the lamp, Jenny?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Sharply</i>] I want you to light the hanging lamp.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JENNY</span>. Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JENNY</span>. Sure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What kind of an answer is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">JENNY</span>] Leave us. I will light the lamp myself. That
will be better.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Go!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JENNY</span>. [<i>Stops</i>] I wonder, ma'am, what you'd say if I did go?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>remains silent</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JENNY</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>comes forward and lights the lamp</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>With concern</i>] Do you think she will go?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Shouldn't wonder. And then we are in for it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It's your fault! You spoil them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Not at all. Can't you see that they are always polite
to me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Because you cringe to them. And you always cringe to
inferiors, for that matter, because, like all despots, you have
the nature of a slave.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. There&mdash;there!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, you cringe before your men, and before your
sergeants, but you cannot get on with your equals or your
superiors.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That's the way of all tyrants&mdash;Do you think she will go?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, if you don't go out and say something nice to her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, for if I should do it, you would say that I was
flirting with the maids.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Mercy, if she should leave! Then I shall have to do the
work, as I did the last time, and my hands will be spoiled.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That is not the worst of it. But if Jenny leaves,
Christine will also leave, and then we shall never get a servant
to the island again. The mate on the steamer scares away every
one that comes to look for a place&mdash;and if he should miss his
chance, then my corporals attend to it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, your corporals, whom I have to feed in my kitchen,
and whom you dare not show the door&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, for then they would also go when their terms were
up&mdash;and we might have to close up the whole gun shop!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It will be our ruin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That's why the officers have proposed to petition His
Royal Majesty for special expense money.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. For whom?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. For the corporals.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Laughing</i>] You are crazy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, laugh a little for me. I need it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I shall soon have forgotten how to laugh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Lighting his cigar</i>] That is something one should
never forget&mdash;it is tedious enough anyhow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, it is not very amusing&mdash;Do you want to play any
more?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, it tires me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know, it irritates me nevertheless that my cousin,
the new Master of Quarantine, makes his first visit to our
enemies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, what's the use of talking about it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But did you see in the paper that he was put down as
<i>rentier</i>? He must have come into some money then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. <i>Rentier</i>! Well, well&mdash;a rich relative. That's really
the first one in this family.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In your family, yes. But among my people many have been
rich.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. If he has money, he's conceited, I suppose, but I'll
hold him in check&mdash;and he won't get a chance to look at my cards.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The telegraph receiver begins to click</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Standing still</i>] Keep quiet, please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, are you not going to look&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I can hear&mdash;I can hear what they are saying&mdash;It's the
children.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Goes over to the instrument and sends an answer; the
receiver continues to click for awhile, and then the</i>
<span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>answers again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Wait a little&mdash;[<i>Gives a final click</i>] The children are
at the guard-house in the city. Judith is not well again and is
staying away from school.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Again! What more did they say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Money, of course!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Why is Judith in such a hurry? If she didn't pass her
examinations until next year, it would be just as well.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Tell her, and see what it helps.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You should tell her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. How many times have I not done so? But children have
their own wills, you know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, in this house at least. [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>yawns</i>] So,
you yawn in your wife's presence!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, what can I do? Don't you notice how day by day we
are saying the same things to each other? When, just now, you
sprang that good old phrase of yours, "in this house at least,"
I should have come back with my own stand-by, "it is not my
house only." But as I have already made that reply some five
hundred times, I yawned instead. And my yawn could be taken to
mean either that I was too lazy to answer, or "right you are, my
angel," or "supposing we quit."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You are very amiable to-night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is it not time for supper soon?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know that the doctor ordered supper from the
city&mdash;from the Grand Hotel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No! Then they are having ptarmigans&mdash;tschk! Ptarmigan,
you know, is the finest bird there is, but it's clear barbarism
to fry it in bacon grease&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Ugh! Don't talk of food.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, how about wines? I wonder what those barbarians
are drinking with the ptarmigans?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you want me to play for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Sits down at the writing-table</i>] The last resource!
Well, if you could only leave your dirges and lamentations
alone&mdash;it sounds too much like music with a moral. And I am
always adding within myself: "Can't you hear how unhappy I am!
Meow, meow! Can't you hear what a horrible husband I have! Brum,
brum, brum! If he would only die soon! Beating of the joyful
drum, flourishes, the finale of the Alcazar Waltz, Champagne
Galop!" Speaking of champagne, I guess there are a couple of
bottles left. What would you say about bringing them up and
pretending to have company?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, we won't, for they are mine&mdash;they were given to me
personally.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You are so economical.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And you are always stingy&mdash;to your wife at least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Then I don't know what to suggest. Perhaps I might
dance for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, thank you&mdash;I guess you are done with dancing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You should bring some friend to stay with you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Thanks! You might bring a friend to stay with you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Thanks! It has been tried, and with mutual
dissatisfaction. But it was interesting in the way of an
experiment, for as soon as a stranger entered the house, we
became quite happy&mdash;to begin with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, don't talk of it!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>There is a knock at the door on the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Who can be coming so late as this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Jenny does not knock.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Go and open the door, and don't yell "come"&mdash;it has a
sound of the workshop.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Goes toward the door on the left</i>] You don't like
workshops.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Please, open!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Opens the door and receives a visiting-card that is
held out to him</i>] It is Christine&mdash;Has Jenny left? [<i>As the
public cannot hear the answer, to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Jenny has left.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then I become servant girl again!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And I man-of-all-work.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Would it not be possible to get one of your gunners to
help along in the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Not these days.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But it couldn't be Jenny who sent in her card?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Looks at the card through his spectacles and then
turns it over to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] You see what it is&mdash;I cannot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Looks at the card</i>] Curt&mdash;it is Curt! Hurry up and
bring him in.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Goes out to the left</i>] Curt! Well, that's a pleasure!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>arranges her hair and seems to come to life</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Enters from the left with</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Here he is, the
traitor! Welcome, old man! Let me hug you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Welcome to my home, Curt!</p>

<p>CURT. Thank you&mdash;it is some time since we saw each other.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. How long? Fifteen years! And we have grown old&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, Curt has not changed, it seems to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Sit down, sit down! And first of all&mdash;the programme.
Have you any engagement for to-night?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am invited to the doctor's, but I have not promised to
go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then you will stay with your relatives.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That would seem the natural thing, but the doctor is my
superior, and I might have trouble afterward.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What kind of talk is that? I have never been afraid of
my superiors&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Fear or no fear, the trouble cannot be escaped.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. On this island I am master. Keep behind my back, and
nobody will dare to touch you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, be quiet, Edgar! [<i>Takes</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>by the hand</i>] Leaving
both masters and superiors aside, you must stay with us. That
will be found both natural and proper.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, then&mdash;especially as I feel welcome here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Why should you not be welcome? There is nothing between
us&mdash;[<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>tries vainly to hide a sense of displeasure</i>] What
could there be? You were a little careless as a young man, but I
have forgotten all about it. I don't let things rankle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>looks annoyed. All three sit down at the
sewing-table</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, you have strayed far and wide in the world?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and now I have found a harbour with you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Whom you married off twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It was not quite that way, but it doesn't matter. It is
pleasing to see that you have stuck together for twenty-five
years.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, we have borne with it. Now and then it has been
so-so, but, as you say, we have stuck together. And Alice
has had nothing to complain of. There has been plenty of
everything&mdash;heaps of money. Perhaps you don't know that I am a
celebrated author&mdash;an author of text-books&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, I recall that, when we parted, you had just published
a volume on rifle practice that was selling well. Is it still
used in the military schools?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is still in evidence, and it holds its place as
number one, though they have tried to substitute a worse one
&mdash;which is being used now, but which is totally worthless.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Painful silence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You have been travelling abroad, I have heard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. We have been down to Copenhagen five times&mdash;think of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, you see, when I took Alice away from the stage&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, you took me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, I took you as a wife should be taken&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. How brave you have grown!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But as it was held up against me afterward that I had
spoiled her brilliant career&mdash;hm!&mdash;I had to make up for it
by promising to take my wife to Copenhagen&mdash;and this I have
kept&mdash;fully! Five times we have been there. Five [<i>holding up
the five fingers of the left hand</i>] Have you been in Copenhagen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Smiling</i>] No, I have mostly been in America.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. America? Isn't that a rotten sort of a country?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Unpleasantly impressed</i>] It is not Copenhagen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have you&mdash;heard anything&mdash;from your children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I hope you pardon me&mdash;but was it not rather inconsiderate
to leave them like that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I didn't leave them, but the court gave them to the mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Don't let us talk of that now. I for my part think it
was lucky for you to get out of that mess.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] How are your children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, thank you. They are at school in the city and will
soon be grown up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, they're splendid kids, and the boy has a brilliant
head&mdash;brilliant! He is going to join the General Staff&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. If they accept him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Him? Who has the making of a War Minister in him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. From one thing to another. There is to be a quarantine
station here&mdash;against plague, cholera, and that sort of thing.
And the doctor will be my superior, as you know&mdash;what sort of
man is he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Man? He is no man! He's an ignorant rascal!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] That is very unpleasant for me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, it is not quite as bad as Edgar makes it out, but I
must admit that I have small sympathy for the man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. A rascal, that's what he is. And that's what the
others are, too&mdash;the Collector of Customs, the Postmaster, the
telephone girl, the druggist, the pilot&mdash;what is it they call
him now?&mdash;the Pilot Master&mdash;rascals one and all&mdash;and that's why
I don't associate with them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are you on bad terms with all of them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Every one!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, it is true that intercourse with those people is out
of the question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is as if all the tyrants of the country had been
sent to this island for safe-keeping.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Ironically</i>] Exactly!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Good-naturedly</i>] Hm! Is that meant for me? I am no
tyrant&mdash;not in my own house at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You know better!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Don't believe her! I am a very reasonable
husband, and the old lady is the best wife in the world.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Would you like something to drink, Curt?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, thank you, not now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have you turned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. A little moderate only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is that American?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No moderation for me, or I don't care at all. A man
should stand his liquor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Returning to our neighbours on the island&mdash;my position
will put me in touch with all of them&mdash;and it is not easy to
steer clear of everything, for no matter how little you care to
get mixed up in other people's intrigues, you are drawn into
them just the same.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You had better take up with them&mdash;in the end you will
return to us, for here you find your true friends.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is it not dreadful to be alone among a lot of enemies as
you are?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It is not pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It isn't dreadful at all. I have never had anything
but enemies all my life, and they have helped me on instead of
doing me harm. And when my time to die comes, I may say that I
owe nothing to anybody, and that I have never got a thing for
nothing. Every particle of what I own I have had to fight for.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, Edgar's path has not been strewn with roses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, with thorns and stones&mdash;pieces of flint&mdash;but a
man's own strength: do you know what that means?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Simply</i>] Yes, I learned to recognise its insufficiency
about ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Then you are no good!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] Edgar!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. He is no good, I say, if he does not have the strength
within himself. Of course it is true that when the mechanism
goes to pieces there is nothing left but a barrowful to chuck
out on the garden beds; but as long as the mechanism holds
together the thing to do is to kick and fight, with hands and
feet, until there is nothing left. That is my philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Smiling</i>] It is fun to listen to you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But you don't think it's true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But true it is, for all that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Money, money, money! All day long I have to
stand ready with the purse, until at last I have come to feel as
if I myself were nothing but a purse. Are you familiar with that
kind of thing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;with the difference that I took myself for a
pocket-book.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Ha-ha! So you know the flavour of the brand! Oh, the
ladies! Ha-ha! And you had one of the proper kind!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Patiently</i>] Let that be buried now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. She was a jewel! Then I have after all&mdash;in spite of
everything&mdash;one that's pretty decent. For she is straight, in
spite of everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Smiling good-humouredly</i>] In spite of everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Don't you laugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>As before</i>] In spite of everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, she has been a faithful mate, a splendid
mother&mdash;excellent&mdash;but [<i>with a glance at the door on the
right</i>] she has a devilish temper. Do you know, there have been
moments when I cursed you for saddling me with her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Good-naturedly</i>] But I didn't. Listen, man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yah, yah, yah! You talk nonsense and forget things that
are not pleasant to remember. Don't take it badly, please&mdash;I am
accustomed to command and raise Cain, you see, but you know me,
and don't get angry!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not at all. But I have not provided you with a wife&mdash;on
the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Without letting his flow of words be checked</i>] Don't
you think life is queer anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And to grow old&mdash;it is no fun, but it is interesting.
Well, my age is nothing to speak of, but it does begin to make
itself felt. All your friends die off, and then you become so
lonely.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Lucky the man who can grow old in company with a wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Lucky? Well, it is luck, for the children go their way,
too. You ought not to have left yours.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, I didn't. They were taken away from me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Don't get mad now, because I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But it was not so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, whichever way it was, it has now become
forgotten&mdash;but you are alone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You get accustomed to everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Do you&mdash;is it possible to get accustomed&mdash;to being
quite alone also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Here am I!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What have you been doing these fifteen years?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What a question! These fifteen years!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. They say you have got hold of money and grown rich.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I can hardly be called rich&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I am not going to ask for a loan.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. If you were, you would find me ready.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Many thanks, but I have my bank account. You see [<i>with
a glance toward the door on the right</i>], nothing must be lacking
in this house; and the day I had no more money&mdash;she would leave
me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No? Well, I know better. Think of it, she makes a point
of asking me when I happen to be short, just for the pleasure of
showing me that I am not supporting my family.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I heard you say that you have a large income.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Of course, I have a large income&mdash;but it is not enough.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then it is not large, as such things are reckoned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Life is queer, and we as well!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The telegraph receiver begins to click</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Nothing but a time correction.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you no telephone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, in the kitchen. But we use the telegraph because
the girls at the central report everything we say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Social conditions out here by the sea must be frightful!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. They are simply horrible! But all life is horrible. And
you, who believe in a sequel, do you think there will be any
peace further on?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I presume there will be storms and battles there also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. There also&mdash;if there be any "there"! I prefer
annihilation!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are you sure that annihilation will come without pain?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I am going to die all of a sudden, without pain</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So you know that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, I know it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You don't appear satisfied with your life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Sighing</i>] Satisfied? The day I could die, I should be
satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] That you don't know! But tell me: what is going
on in this house? What is happening here? There is a smell as of
poisonous wall-paper, and one feels sick the moment one enters.
I should prefer to get away from here, had I not promised Alice
to stay. There are dead bodies beneath the flooring, and the
place is so filled with hatred that one can hardly breathe.
[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>sinks together and sits staring into vacancy</i>]
What is the matter with you? Edgar! [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>does not

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Recovering consciousness</i>] Did you say anything?
[<i>Looks around</i>] I thought it was&mdash;Alice!&mdash;Oh, is that
you?&mdash;Say&mdash;[<i>Relapses into apathy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. This is horrible! [<i>Goes over to the door on the right and
opens it</i>] Alice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Enters, wearing a kitchen apron</i>] What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I don't know. Look at him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Calmly</i>] He goes off like that at times&mdash;I'll play and
then he will wake up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, don't! Not that way! Leave it to me&mdash;Does he hear? Or
see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Just now he neither hears nor sees.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And you can speak of that with such calm? Alice, what is
going on in this house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Ask him there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Him there? But he is your husband!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. A stranger to me&mdash;as strange as he was twenty-five years
ago. I know nothing at all about that man&mdash;nothing but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Stop! He may overhear you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now he cannot hear anything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>A trumpet signal is sounded outside</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Leaps to his feet and grabs sabre and cap</i>] Pardon
me. I have to inspect the sentries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes out through the door in the background</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is he ill?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Has he lost his reason?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Does he drink?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He boasts more of it than he really drinks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Sit down and talk&mdash;but calmly and truthfully.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Sitting down</i>] What am I to talk about? That I have
spent a lifetime in this tower, locked up, guarded by a man whom
I have always hated, and whom I now hate so beyond all bounds
that the day he died I should be laughing until the air shook.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why have you not parted?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You may well ask! While still engaged we parted twice;
since then we have been trying to part every single day&mdash;but
we are chained together and cannot break away. Once we were
separated&mdash;within the same house&mdash;for five whole years. Now
nothing but death can part us. This we know, and for that reason
we are waiting for him as for a liberator.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why are you so lonely?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Because he isolates me. First he "exterminated" all my
brothers and sisters from our home&mdash;he speaks of it himself as
"extermination"&mdash;and then my girl friends and everybody else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But <i>his</i> relatives? He has not "exterminated" them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, for they came near taking my life, after having
taken my honour and good name. Finally I became forced to keep
up my connection with the world and with other human beings by
means of that telegraph&mdash;for the telephone was watched by the
operators. I have taught myself telegraphy, and he doesn't know
it. You must not tell him, for then he would kill me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Frightful! Frightful!&mdash;But why does he hold me responsible
for your marriage? Let me tell you now how it was. Edgar
was my childhood friend. When he saw you he fell in love at
once. He came to me and asked me to plead his cause. I said
no at once&mdash;and, my dear Alice, I knew your tyrannical and
cruel temperament. For that reason I warned him&mdash;and when he
persisted, I sent him to get your brother for his spokesman.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I believe what you say. But he has been deceiving himself
all these years, so that now you can never get him to believe
anything else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, let him put the blame on me if that can relieve his
sufferings.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But that is too much&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am used to it. But what does hurt me is his unjust
charge that I have deserted my children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That's the manner of man he is. He says what suits
him, and then he believes it. But he seems to be fond of you,
principally because you don't contradict him. Try not to grow
tired of us now. I believe you have come in what was to us a
fortunate moment; I think it was even providential&mdash;Curt, you
must not grow tired of us, for we are undoubtedly the most
unhappy creatures in the whole world!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She weeps</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have seen <i>one</i> marriage at close quarters, and it was
dreadful&mdash;but this is almost worse!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Whose fault is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. The moment you quit asking whose fault it is, Alice, you
will feel a relief. Try to regard it as a fact, a trial that has
to be borne&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I cannot do it! It is too much! [Rising] It is beyond
help!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I pity both of you!&mdash;Do you know why you are hating each
other?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, it is the most unreasoning hatred, without cause,
without purpose, but also without end. And can you imagine why
he is principally afraid of death? He fears that I may marry
again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then he loves you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Probably. But that does not prevent him from hating me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>As if to himself</i>] It is called love-hatred, and it
hails from the pit!&mdash;Does he like you to play for him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, but only horrid melodies&mdash;for instance, that awful
"The Entry of the Boyars." When he hears it he loses his head
and wants to dance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Does he dance?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, he is very funny at times.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. One thing&mdash;pardon me for asking. Where are the children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Perhaps you don't know that two of them are dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So you have had that to face also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What is there I have not faced?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But the other two?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In the city. They couldn't stay at home. For he set them
against me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And you set them against him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Of course. And then parties were formed, votes bought,
bribes given&mdash;and in order not to spoil the children completely
we had to part from them. What should have been the uniting link
became the seed of dissension; what is held the blessing of the
home turned into a curse&mdash;well, I believe sometimes that we
belong to a cursed race!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, is it not so&mdash;ever since the Fall?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>With a venomous glance and sharp voice</i>] What fall?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That of our first parents.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, I thought you meant something else!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Embarrassed silence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>With folded hands</i>] Curt, my kinsman, my childhood
friend&mdash;I have not always acted toward you as I should. But now
I am being punished, and you are having your revenge.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No revenge! Nothing of that kind here! Hush!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you recall one Sunday while you were engaged&mdash;and I
had invited you for dinner&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Never mind!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I must speak! Have pity on me! When you came to dinner,
we had gone away, and you had to leave again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You had received an invitation yourselves&mdash;what is that to
speak of!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Curt, when to-day, a little while ago, I asked you to
stay for supper, I thought we had something left in the pantry.
[<i>Hiding her face in her hands</i>] And there is not a thing, not
even a piece of bread&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. <i>Weeping</i>] Alice&mdash;poor Alice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But when he comes home and wants something to eat, and
there is nothing&mdash;then he gets angry. You have never seen him
angry! O, God, what humiliation!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Will you not let me go out and arrange for something?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There is nothing to be had on this island.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not for my sake, but for his and yours&mdash;let me think
up something&mdash;something. We must make the whole thing seem
laughable when he comes. I'll propose that we have a drink, and
in the meantime I'll think of something. Put him in good humour;
play for him, any old nonsense. Sit down at the piano and make
yourself ready&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Look at my hands&mdash;are they fit to play with? I have to
wipe glasses and polish brass, sweep floors, and make fires&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But you have two servants?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. So we have to pretend because he is an officer&mdash;but the
servants are leaving us all the time, so that often we have
none at all&mdash;most of the time, in fact. How am I to get out of
this&mdash;this about supper? Oh, if only fire would break out in
this house!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Don't, Alice, don't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. If the sea would rise and take us away!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, no, no, I cannot listen to you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What will he say, what will he say&mdash;Don't go, Curt, don't
go away from me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, dear Alice&mdash;I shall not go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, but when you are gone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Has he ever laid hands on you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. On me? Oh, no, for he knew that then I should have left
him. One has to preserve some pride.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. While you are waiting for an answer from the city, I'll go
over to the doctor and have a talk with him. Has he attended you
before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. He has.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then he knows your case. [Goes <i>toward the left</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There will be an answer shortly. It is very kind of you,
Curt. But come back soon.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. As soon as I can. [<i>Goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Curt <i>is</i> kind! And how he has changed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, and for the better. It is too bad, however, that he
must be dragged into our misery just now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But good for us&mdash;I wonder just how he stands. Did you
notice that he wouldn't speak of his own affairs?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I did notice it, but then I don't think anybody asked him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Think, what a life! And ours! I wonder if it is the
same for all people?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Perhaps, although they don't speak of it as we do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. At times I have thought that misery draws misery, and
that those who are happy shun the unhappy. That is the reason
why we see nothing but misery.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have you known anybody who was happy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Let me see! No&mdash;Yes&mdash;the Ekmarks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You don't mean it! She had to have an operation last
year&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That's right. Well, then I don't know&mdash;yes, the Von
Kraffts.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, the whole family lived an idyllic life, well off,
respected by everybody, nice children, good marriages&mdash;right
along until they were fifty. Then that cousin of theirs
committed a crime that led to a prison term and all sorts
of after-effects. And that was the end of their peace. The
family name was dragged in the mud by all the newspapers. The
Krafft murder case made it impossible for the family to appear
anywhere, after having been so much thought of. The children had
to be taken out of school. Oh, heavens!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I wonder what my trouble is?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Heart or head. It is as if the soul wanted to fly off
and turn into smoke.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have you any appetite?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, how about the supper?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Crosses the stage, disturbed</i>] I'll ask Jenny.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Why, she's gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, yes, yes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Ring for Christine so that I can get some fresh water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Rings</i>] I wonder&mdash;[<i>Rings again</i>] She doesn't hear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Go and look&mdash;just think, if she should have left also!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Goes over to the door on the left and opens it</i>] What
is this? Her trunk is in the hallway&mdash;packed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Then she has gone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. This is hell!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Begins to cry, falls on her knees, and puts her head
on a chair, sobbing</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And everything at once! And then Curt had to turn up
just in time to get a look into this mess of ours! If there be
any further humiliation in store, let it come this moment!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know what I suspect? Curt went away and will not
come back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I believe it of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, we are cursed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What are you talking of?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't you see how everybody shuns us?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't mind! [<i>The telegraph receiver clicks</i>] There
is the answer. Hush, I can hear it&mdash;Nobody can spare the time.
Evasions! The rabble!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That's what you get because you have despised your
physicians&mdash;and failed to pay them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That is not so!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Even when you could, you didn't care to pay their bills
because you looked down upon their work, just as you have looked
down upon mine and everybody else's. They don't want to come.
And the telephone is cut off because you didn't think that
good for anything either. Nothing is good for anything but your
rifles and guns!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Don't stand there and talk nonsense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Everything comes back.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What sort of superstition is that? Talk for old women!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You will see! Do you know that we owe Christine six
months' wages?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, she has stolen that much.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But I have also had to borrow money from her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I think you capable of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What an ingrate you are! You know I borrowed that money
for the children to get into the city.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Curt had a fine way of coming back! A rascal, that one,
too! And a coward! He didn't dare to say he had had enough, and
that he found the doctor's party more pleasant&mdash;He's the same
rapscallion as ever!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters quickly from the left</i>] Well, my dear Edgar, this
is how the matter stands&mdash;the doctor knows everything about your
heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. My heart?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You have long been suffering from calcification of the
heart&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Stone heart?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is it serious?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, that is to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is serious.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Fatal?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You must be very careful. First of all: the cigar must
go. [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>throws away his cigar</i>] And next: no more
whiskey! Then, to bed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Scared</i>] No, I don't want <i>that</i>! Not to bed! That's
the end! Then you never get up again. I shall sleep on the couch
to-night. What more did he say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He was very nice about it and will come at once if you
call him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Was he nice, the hypocrite? I don't want to see him! I
can at least eat?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not to-night. And during the next few days nothing but
milk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Milk! I cannot take that stuff into my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Better learn how!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I am too old to learn. [<i>Puts his hand up to his head</i>]
Oh, there it is again now!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He sits perfectly still, staring straight ahead</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] What did the doctor tell you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That he <i>may</i> die.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Thank God!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Take care, Alice, take care! And now, go and get a pillow
and a blanket and I'll put him here on the couch. Then I'll sit
on the chair here all night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You go to bed. Your presence seems only to make him worse.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Command! I shall obey, for you seem to mean well toward
both of us. [<i>Goes out to the left</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Mark you&mdash;toward both of you! And I shall not mix in any
partisan squabbles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>takes the water bottle and goes out to the
right. The noise of the wind outside is clearly
heard. Then one of the doors is blown open and an old
woman of shabby, unprepossessing appearance peeps
into the room</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Wakes up, rises, and looks around</i>] So, they have
left me, the rascals! [<i>Catches sight of the old woman and is
frightened by her</i>] Who is it? What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD WOMAN</span>. I just wanted to close the door, sir.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Why should you? Why should you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD WOMAN</span>. Because it blew open just as I passed by.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Wanted to steal, did you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD WOMAN</span>. Not much here to take away, Christine said.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Christine?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">OLD WOMAN</span>. Good night, sir, and sleep well!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Closes the door and disappears.</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>comes in from the left with pillows and a
blanket.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Who was that at the door? Anybody?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Why, it was old Mary from the poorhouse who just went by.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Are you afraid?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I, afraid? Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. As you don't want to go to bed, you can lie here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Goes over to the couch and lies down</i>] I'll lie here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Tries to take</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span><i>'s hand, but she pulls it
away.</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>comes in with the water bottle</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Curt, don't go away from me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am going to stay up with you all night. Alice is going
to bed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Good night then, Alice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Good night, Curt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Good night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Takes a chair and sits down beside the couch</i>] Don't you
want to take off your boots?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, a warrior should always be armed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are you expecting a battle then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Perhaps! [<i>Rising up in bed</i>] Curt, you are the only
human being to whom I ever disclosed anything of myself. Listen
to me!&mdash;If I die to-night&mdash;look after my children!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I will do so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Thank you&mdash;I trust in you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Can you explain why you trust me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. We have not been friends, for friendship is something
I don't believe in, and our families were born enemies and have
always been at war&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And yet you trust me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, and I don't know why. [<i>Silence</i>] Do you think I
am going to die?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You as well as everybody. There will be no exception made
in your case.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Are you bitter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes&mdash;are you afraid of death? Of the wheelbarrow and the
garden bed?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Think, if it were not the end!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's what a great many think!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Nothing but surprises, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But nothing at all is known with certainty?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, that's just it! That is why you must be prepared for
everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You are not childish enough to believe in a hell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you not believe in it&mdash;you, who are right in it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That is metaphorical only.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. The realism with which you have described yours seems to
preclude all thought of metaphors, poetical or otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Silence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. If you only knew what pangs I suffer!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Of the body?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, not of the body.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then it must be of the spirit, for no other alternative
exists. [<i>Pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rising up in bed</i>] I don't want to die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not long ago you wished for annihilation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, if it be painless.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Apparently it is not!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is this annihilation then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. The beginning of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Good night.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Good night.</p>

<h5><i>Curtain</i>. </h5>
<hr class="tb" />


<blockquote>

<p><i>The same setting, but note the lamp is at the point
of going out. Through the windows and the glass panes
of the doors a gray morning is visible. The sea is
stirring. The sentry is on the battery as before</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>is lying on the couch, asleep</i>. <span class="small-c">CURT</span>
<i>sits on a chair beside him, looking pale and wearied
from his watch</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>In from the left</i>] Is he asleep?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, since the time when the sun should have risen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What kind of night did he have?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He slept now and then, but he talked a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Of what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He argued about religion like a schoolboy, but with a
pretension of having solved all the world riddles. Finally,
toward morning, he invented the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. For his own glory.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Exactly! He is actually the most conceited person I have
ever met. "I am; consequently God must be."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You have become aware of it? Look at those boots. With
those he would have trampled the earth flat, had he been allowed
to do so. With those he has trampled down other people's fields
and gardens. With those he has trampled on some people's toes
and other people's heads&mdash;Man-eater, you have got your bullet at
last!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He would be comical were he not so tragical; and there are
traces of greatness in all his narrow-mindedness&mdash;Have you not a
single good word to say about him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Sitting down</i>] Yes, if he only does not hear it; for if
he hears a single word of praise he develops megalomania on the
spot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He can hear nothing now, for he has had a dose of morphine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Born in a poor home, with many brothers and sisters,
Edgar very early had to support the family by giving lessons,
as the father was a ne'er-do-well if nothing worse. It must be
hard for a young man to give up all the pleasures of youth in
order to slave for a bunch of thankless children whom he has not
brought into the world. I was a little girl when I saw him, as
a young man, going without an overcoat in the winter while the
mercury stood at fifteen below zero&mdash;his little sisters wore
kersey coats&mdash;it was fine, and I admired him, but his ugliness
repelled me. Is he not unusually ugly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and his ugliness has a touch of the monstrous at
times. Whenever we fell out, I noticed it particularly. And
when, at such times, he went away, his image assumed enormous
forms and proportions, and he literally haunted me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Think of me then! However, his earlier years as an
officer were undoubtedly a martyrdom. But now and then he was
helped by rich people. This he will never admit, and whatever
has come to him in that way he has accepted as a due tribute,
without giving thanks for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. We were to speak well of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes&mdash;after he is dead. But then I recall nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you found him cruel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes&mdash;and yet he can show himself both kind and
susceptible to sentiment. As an enemy he is simply horrible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why did he not get the rank of major?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, you ought to understand that! They didn't want to
raise a man above themselves who had already proved himself a
tyrant as an inferior. But you must never let on that you know
this. He says himself that he did not want promotion&mdash;Did he
speak of the children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, he was longing for Judith.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I thought so&mdash;Oh! Do you know what Judith is? His own
image, whom he has trained for use against me. Think only, that
my own daughter&mdash;has raised her hand against me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That is too much!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Hush! He is moving&mdash;Think if he overheard us! He is full
of trickery also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He is actually waking up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Does he not look like an ogre? I am afraid of him!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Silence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Stirs, wakes up, rises in bed, and looks around</i>] It
is morning&mdash;at last!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How are you feeling?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Not so very bad.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you want a doctor?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No&mdash;I want to see Judith&mdash;my child!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Would it not be wise to set your house in order before&mdash;or
if something should happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What do you mean? What could happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What may happen to all of us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, nonsense! Don't you believe that I die so easily!
And don't rejoice prematurely, Alice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Think of your children. Make your will so that your wife
at least may keep the household goods.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is she going to inherit from me while I am still alive?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, but if something happens she ought not to be turned
into the street. One who has dusted and polished and looked
after these things for twenty-five years should have some
right to remain in possession of them. May I send word to the
regimental lawyer?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You are a cruel man&mdash;more cruel than I thought you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Now it is back again!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Falls back on the bed unconscious</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Goes toward the right</i>] There are some people in the
kitchen&mdash;I have to go down there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, go. Here is not much to be done.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Recovers</i>] Well, Curt, what are you going to do about
your quarantine?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, that will be all right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No; I am in command on this island, so you will have to
deal with me&mdash;don't forget that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you ever seen a quarantine station?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have I? Before you were born. And I'll give you a piece
of advice: don't place your disinfection plant too close to the
shore.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I was thinking that the nearer I could get to the water
the better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That shows how much you know of your business. Water,
don't you see, is the element of the bacilli, their life element?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But the salt water of the sea is needed to wash away all
the impurity.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Idiot! Well, now, when you get a house for yourself I
suppose you'll bring home your children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you think they will let themselves be brought?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Of course, if you have got any backbone! It would make
a good impression on the people if you fulfilled your duties in
that respect also&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have always fulfilled my duties in that respect.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Raising his voice</i>]&mdash;in the one respect where you
have proved yourself most remiss&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have I not told you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Paying no attention</i>]&mdash;for one does not desert one's
children like that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Go right on!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. As your relative&mdash;a relative older than yourself&mdash;I
feel entitled to tell you the truth, even if it should prove
bitter&mdash;and you should not take it badly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are you hungry?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you want something light?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, something solid.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then you would be done for.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is it not enough to be sick, but one must starve also?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's how the land lies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And neither drink nor smoke? Then life is not worth
much!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Death demands sacrifices, or it comes at once.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Enters with several bunches of flowers and some
telegrams and letters</i>] These are for you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Throws the flowers on the writing-table</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Flattered</i>] For me! Will you please let me look?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, they are only from the non-commissioned officers, the
bandmen, and the gunners.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You are jealous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, no. If it were laurel wreaths, that would be another
matter&mdash;but those you can never get.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Hm!&mdash;Here's a telegram from the Colonel&mdash;read it, Curt.
The Colonel is a gentleman after all&mdash;though he is something of
an idiot. And this is from&mdash;what does it say? It is from Judith!
Please telegraph her to come with the next boat. And here&mdash;yes,
one is not quite without friends after all, and it is fine to
see them take thought of a sick man, who is also a man of
deserts above his rank, and a man free of fear or blemish.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I don't quite understand&mdash;are they congratulating you
because you are sick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Hyena!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, we had a doctor here on the island who was so hated
that when he left they gave a banquet&mdash;after him, and not for
him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Put the flowers in water&mdash;I am not easily caught, and
all people are a lot of rabble, but, by heavens, these simple
tributes are genuine&mdash;they cannot be anything but genuine!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Fool!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Reading the telegram</i>] Judith says she cannot come
because the steamer is held back by the storm.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is that all?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No-o&mdash;there is a postscript.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Out with it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, she asks her father not to drink so much.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Impudence! That's like children! That's my only beloved
daughter&mdash;my Judith&mdash;my idol!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And your image!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Such is life. Such are its best joys&mdash;Hell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now you get the harvest of your sowing. You have set her
against her own mother and now she turns against the father.
Tell me, then, that there is no God!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] What does the Colonel say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He grants leave of absence without any comment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Leave of absence? I have not asked for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, but I have asked for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't accept it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Order has already been issued.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That's none of my concern!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you see, Curt, that for this man exist no laws,
no constitutions, no prescribed human order? He stands above
everything and everybody. The universe is created for his
private use. The sun and the moon pursue their courses in order
to spread his glory among the stars. Such is this man: this
insignificant captain, who could not even reach the rank of
major, and at whose strutting everybody laughs, while he thinks
himself feared; this poor wretch who is afraid in the dark and
believes in barometers: and all this in conjunction with and
having for its climax&mdash;a barrowful of manure that is not even
prime quality!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Fanning himself with a bunch of flowers, conceitedly,
without listening to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Have you asked Curt to breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Get us, then, at once two nice tenderloin steaks.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Two?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I am going to have one myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But we are three here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, you want one also? Well, make it three then.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Where am I to get them? Last night you asked Curt to
supper, and there was not a crust of bread in the house. Curt
has been awake all night without anything to eat, and he has had
no coffee because there is none in the house and the credit is
gone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. She is angry at me for not dying yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, for not dying twenty-five years ago&mdash;for not dying
before you were born!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Listen to her! That's what happens when you
institute a marriage, my dear Curt. And it is perfectly clear
that it was not instituted in heaven.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>look at each other meaningly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rises and goes toward the door</i>] However, say what
you will, now I am going on duty. [<i>Puts on an old-fashioned
helmet with a brush crest, girds on the sabre, and shoulders his
cloak</i>] If anybody calls for me, I am at the battery. [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>try vainly to hold him back</i>] Stand aside!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, go! You always go, always show your back, whenever
the fight becomes too much for you. And then you let your wife
cover the retreat&mdash;you hero of the bottle, you arch-braggart,
you arch-liar! Fie on you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. This is bottomless!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And you don't know everything yet.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is there anything more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But I am ashamed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Where is he going now? And where does he get the strength?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, you may well ask! Now he goes down to the
non-commissioned officers and thanks them for the flowers&mdash;and
then he eats and drinks with them. And then he speaks ill of all
the other officers&mdash;If you only knew how many times he has been
threatened with discharge! Nothing but sympathy for his family
has saved him. And this he takes for fear of his superiority.
And he hates and maligns the very women&mdash;wives of other
officers&mdash;who have been pleading our cause.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have to confess that I applied for this position in
order to find peace by the sea&mdash;and of your circumstances I knew
nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Poor Curt! And how will you get something to eat?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, I can go over to the doctor's&mdash;but you? Will you not
permit me to arrange this for you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. If only he does not learn of it, for then he would kill
me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Looking out through the window</i>] Look, he stands right
in the wind out there on the rampart.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He is to be pitied&mdash;for being what he is!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Both of you are to be pitied! But what can be done?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I don't know&mdash;The mail brought a batch of unpaid bills
also, and those he did not see.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It may be fortunate to escape seeing things at times.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>At the window</i>] He has unbuttoned his cloak and lets
the wind strike his chest. Now he wants to die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That is not what he wants, I think, for a while ago, when
he felt his life slipping away, he grabbed hold of mine and
began to stir in my affairs as if he wanted to crawl into me and
live my life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That is just his vampire nature&mdash;to interfere with other
people's destinies, to suck interest out of other existences,
to regulate and arrange the doings of others, since he can
find no interest whatever in his own life. And remember, Curt,
don't ever admit him into your family life, don't ever make him
acquainted with your friends, for he will take them away from
you and make them his own. He is a perfect magician in this
respect. Were he to meet your children, you would soon find them
intimate with <i>him</i>, and he would be advising them and educating
them to suit himself&mdash;but principally in opposition to <i>your</i>
wishes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Alice, was it not he who took my children away from me at
the time of the divorce?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Since it is all over now&mdash;yes, it was he.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have suspected it, but never had any certainty. It was
he!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. When you placed your full trust in my husband and sent
him to make peace between yourself and your wife, he made love
to her instead, and taught her the trick that gave her the
children.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, God! God in heaven!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There you have another side of him. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you know, last night&mdash;when he thought himself
dying&mdash;then&mdash;he made me promise that I should look after his
children!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But you don't want to revenge yourself on my children?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes&mdash;by keeping my promise. I shall look after your
children.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You could take no worse revenge, for there is nothing he
hates so much as generosity.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I may consider myself revenged&mdash;without any revenge.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I love revenge as a form of justice, and I am yearning to
see evil get its punishment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You still remain at that point?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There I shall always remain, and the day I forgave or
loved an enemy I should be a hypocrite.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It may be a duty not to say everything, Alice, not to see
everything. It is called forbearance, and all of us need it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Not I! My life lies clear and open, and I have always
played my cards straight.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That is saying a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, it is not saying enough. Because what I have suffered
innocently for the sake of this man, whom I never loved&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why did you marry?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Who can tell? Because he took me, seduced me! I don't
know. And then I was longing to get up on the heights&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And deserted your art?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Which was despised! But you know, he cheated me! He held
out hopes of a pleasant life, a handsome home&mdash;and there was
nothing but debts; no gold except on the uniform&mdash;and even that
was not real gold. He cheated me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Wait a moment! When a young man falls in love, he sees
the future in a hopeful light: that his hopes are not always
realized, one must pardon. I have the same kind of deceit on my
own conscience without thinking myself dishonest&mdash;What is it
you see on the rampart?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I want to see if he has fallen down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Has he?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No&mdash;worse luck! He is cheating me all the time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I shall call on the doctor and the lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Sitting down at the window</i>] Yes, dear Curt, go. I
shall sit here and wait. And I have learned how to wait!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Same setting in full daylight. The sentry is pacing
back and forth on the battery as before</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>sits in the right-hand easy-chair. Her hair is
now gray</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters from the left after having knocked</i>] Good day,
Alice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Good day, Curt. Sit down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Sits down in the left-hand easy-chair</i>] The steamer is
just coming in.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then I know what's in store, for he is on board.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, he is, for I caught the glitter of his helmet&mdash;What
has he been doing in the city?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, I can figure it out. He dressed for parade, which
means that he saw the Colonel, and he put on white gloves, which
means that he made some calls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Did you notice his quiet manner yesterday? Since he has
quit drinking and become temperate, he is another man: calm,
reserved, considerate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I know it, and if that man had always kept sober he would
have been a menace to humanity. It is perhaps fortunate for the
rest of mankind that he made himself ridiculous and harmless
through his whiskey.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. The spirit in the bottle has chastised him&mdash;But have you
noticed since death put its mark on him that he has developed a
dignity which elevates? And is it not possible that with this
new idea of immortality may have come a new outlook upon life?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You are deceiving yourself. He is conjuring up something
evil. And don't you believe what he says, for he lies with
premeditation, and he knows the art of intriguing as no one
else&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Watching</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Why, Alice, what does this mean? Your
hair has turned gray in these two nights!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, my friend, it has long been gray, and I have simply
neglected to darken it since my husband is as good as dead.
Twenty-five years in prison&mdash;do you know that this place served
as a prison in the old days?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Prison&mdash;well, the walls show it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And my complexion! Even the children took on prison color
in here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I find it hard to imagine children prattling within these
walls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There was not much prattling done either. And those two
that died perished merely from lack of light.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What do you think is coming next?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. The decisive blow at us two. I caught a familiar glimmer
in his eye when you read out that telegram from Judith. It
ought, of course, to have been directed against her, but she,
you know, is inviolate, and so his hatred sought you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What are his intentions in regard to me, do you think?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Hard to tell, but he possesses a marvellous skill in
nosing out other people's secrets&mdash;and did you notice how, all
day yesterday, he seemed to be living in your quarantine; how
he drank a life-interest out of your existence; how he ate your
children alive? A cannibal, I tell you&mdash;for I know him. His own
life is going, or has gone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I also have that impression of his being already on the
other side. His face seems to phosphoresce, as if he were in
a state of decay&mdash;and his eyes flash like will-o'-the-wisps
over graves or morasses&mdash;Here he comes! Tell him you thought it
possible he might be jealous.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, he is too self-conceited. "Show me the man of whom I
need to be jealous!" Those are his own words.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So much the better, for even his faults carry with them a
certain merit&mdash;Shall I get up and meet him anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, be impolite, or he will think you false. And if he
begins to lie, pretend to believe him. I know perfectly how to
translate his lies, and get always at the truth with the help of
my dictionary. I foresee something dreadful&mdash;but, Curt, don't
lose your self-control! My own advantage in our long struggle
has been that I was always sober, and for that reason in full
control of myself. He was always tripped by his whiskey&mdash;Now we
shall see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>In from the left in full uniform, with helmet, cloak,
and white gloves. Calm, dignified, but pale and hollow-eyed.
Moves forward with a tottering step and sinks down, his helmet

from</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Good day. Pardon me for sitting down
like this, but I feel a little tired.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Good day. Welcome home.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. How are you feeling?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Splendid! Only a little tired&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What news from the city?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, a little of everything. I saw the doctor, among
other things, and he said it was nothing at all&mdash;that I might
live twenty years, if I took care of myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Now he is lying. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] Why,
that's fine, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. So much for that.</p>

<p><i>Silence, during which the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>is looking at</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>as if expecting them to speak</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Don't say a word, but let him begin&mdash;then he
will show his cards.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Did you say anything?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, not a word.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Dragging on the words</i>] Well, Curt!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] There&mdash;now he is coming out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, I went to the city, as you know. [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>nods
assent</i>] Mm-mm, I picked up acquaintances&mdash;and among others&mdash;a
young cadet [<i>dragging</i>] in the artillery. [<i>Pause, during
which</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>shows some agitation</i>] As&mdash;we are in need of cadets
right here, I arranged with the Colonel to let him come here.
This ought to please you, especially when I inform you that&mdash;he
is&mdash;your own son!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] The vampire&mdash;don't you see?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Under ordinary circumstances that ought to please a
father, but in my case it will merely be painful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't see why it should!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You don't need to&mdash;it is enough that I don't want it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Oh, you think so? Well, then, you ought to know that
the young man has been ordered to report here, and that from now
on he has to obey me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I shall force him to seek transfer to another
regiment.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You cannot do it, as you have no rights over your son.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, for the court gave those rights to the mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I shall communicate with the mother.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You don't need to.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Don't need to?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, for I have already done so. Yah!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>rises but sinks back again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Now he must die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why, he <i>is</i> a cannibal!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. So much for that! [<i>Straight to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Did
you say anything?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No&mdash;have you grown hard of hearing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, a little&mdash;but if you come nearer to me I can tell
you something between ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That is not necessary&mdash;and a witness is sometimes good to
have for both parties.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You are right; witnesses are sometimes good to have!
But, first of all, did you get that will?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Hands him a document</i>] The regimental lawyer drew it up
himself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. In your favor&mdash;good! [<i>Reads the document and then
tears it carefully into strips which he throws on the floor</i>] So
much for that! Yah!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Did you ever see such a man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That is no man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, Alice, this was what I wanted to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Alarmed</i>] Go on, please.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN. [<i>Calmly as before</i>] On account of your long cherished
desire to quit this miserable existence in an unhappy marriage;
on account of the lack of feeling with which you have treated
your husband and children, and on account of the carelessness
you have shown in the handling of our domestic economy, I have,
during this trip to the city, filed an application for divorce
in the City Court.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh&mdash;and your grounds?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Calmly as before</i>] Besides the grounds already
mentioned, I have others of a purely personal nature. As it
has been found that I may live another twenty years, I am
contemplating a change from this unhappy marital union to one
that suits me better, and I mean to join my fate to that of some
woman capable of devotion to her husband, and who also may bring
into the home not only youth, but&mdash;let us say&mdash;a little beauty!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Takes the wedding-ring from her finger and throws it at
the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] You are welcome!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Picks up the ring and puts it in his rest pocket</i>]
She throws away the ring. The witness will please take notice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Rises in great agitation</i>] And you intend to turn me
out in order to put another woman into my home?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yah!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, then, we'll speak plain language! Cousin Curt, that
man is guilty of an attempt to murder his wife.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. An attempt to murder?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, he pushed me into the water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Without witnesses!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He lies again&mdash;Judith saw it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, what of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. She can testify to it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, she cannot, for she says that she didn't see
anything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You have taught the child to lie!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I didn't need to, for you had taught her already.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You have met Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yah!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, God! Oh, God!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The fortress has surrendered. The enemy will be
permitted to depart in safety on ten minutes' notice. [<i>Places
his watch on the table</i>] Ten minutes&mdash;watch on the table! [Stops
<i>and puts one hand up to his heart</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Goes over to the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>and takes his arm</i>] What is
it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you want anything&mdash;a drink?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Whiskey? No, I don't want to die&mdash;You! [<i>Straightening
himself up</i>] Don't touch me! Ten minutes, or the garrison will
be massacred. [<i>Pulls the sabre partly from the scabbard</i>] Ten
minutes!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes out through the background</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What kind of man is this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He is a demon, and no man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What does he want with my son?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He wants him as hostage in order to be your master&mdash;he
wants to isolate you from the authorities of the island&mdash;Do you
know that the people around here have named this island "Little
Hell"?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I didn't know that&mdash;Alice, you are the first woman who
ever inspired me with compassion&mdash;all others have seemed to me
to deserve their fate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't desert me now! Don't leave me, for he will beat
me&mdash;he has been doing so all these twenty-five years&mdash;in the
presence of the children&mdash;and he has pushed me into the water&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Having heard this, I place myself absolutely against him.
I came here without an angry thought, without memory of his
former slanders and attempts to humiliate me. I forgave him even
when you told me that he was the man who had parted me from my
children&mdash;for he was ill and dying&mdash;but now, when he wants to
steal my son, he must die&mdash;he or I!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Good! No surrender of the fortress! But blow it up
instead, with him in it, even if we have to keep him company! I
am in charge of the powder!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. There was no malice in me when I came here, and I wanted
to run away when I felt myself infected with your hatred, but
now I am moved by an irresistible impulse to hate this man, as I
hate everything that is evil. What can be done?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I have learned the tactics from him. Drum up his enemies
and seek allies.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Just think&mdash;that he should get hold of my wife! Why didn't
those two meet a life-time ago? Then there would have been a
battle-royal that had set the earth quaking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But now these souls have spied each other&mdash;and yet they
must part. I guess what is his most vulnerable spot&mdash;I have long
suspected it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Who is his most faithful enemy on the island?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. The Quartermaster.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is he an honest man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He is. And he knows what I&mdash;I know too&mdash;he knows what the
Sergeant-Major and the Captain have been up to.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What they have been up to? You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Defalcations!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. This is terrible! No, I don't want to have any finger in
that mess!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Ha-ha! You cannot hit an enemy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Formerly I could, but I can do so no longer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Because I have discovered&mdash;that justice is done anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And you could wait for that? Then your son would already
have been taken away from you. Look at my gray hairs&mdash;just feel
how thick it still is, for that matter&mdash;He intends to marry
again, and then I shall be free&mdash;to do the same&mdash;I am free!
And in ten minutes he will be under arrest down below, right
under us&mdash;[<i>stamps her foot on the floor</i>] right under us&mdash;and
I shall dance above his head&mdash;I shall dance "The Entry of the
Boyars"&mdash;[<i>makes a few steps with her arms akimbo</i>] ha-ha-ha-ha!
And I shall play on the piano so that he can hear it.
[<i>Hammering on the piano</i>] Oh, the tower is opening its gates,
and the sentry with the drawn sabre will no longer be guarding
me, but him&mdash;<i>Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre</i>! Him, him, him, the
sentry is going to guard!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Has been watching her with an intoxicated look in his
eyes</i>] Alice, are you, too, a devil?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Jumps up on a chair and pulls down the wreaths</i>] These
we will take along when we depart&mdash;the laurels of triumph! And
fluttering ribbons! A little dusty, but eternally green&mdash;like my
youth&mdash;I am not old, Curt?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. <i>With shining eyes</i>] You are a devil!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In "Little Hell"&mdash;Listen! Now I shall fix my hair
&mdash;[<i>loosens her hair</i>], dress in two minutes&mdash;go to the
Quartermaster in two minutes&mdash;and then, up in the air with the
fortress!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>As before</i>] You are a devil!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That's what you always used to say when we were children.
Do you remember when we were small and became engaged to each
other? Ha-ha! You were bashful, of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Seriously</i>] Alice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, you were! And it was becoming to you. Do you know
there are gross women who like modest men? And there are said to
be modest men who like gross women&mdash;You liked me a little bit,
didn't you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I don't know where I am!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. With an actress whose manners are free, but who is an
excellent lady otherwise. Yes! But now I am free, free, free!
Turn away and I'll change my waist!</p>

<p><i>She opens her waist</i>. <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>rushes up to her, grabs her in his
arms, lifts her high up, and bites her throat so that she cries
out. Then he drops her on the couch and runs out to the left</i>.</p>

<h5><i>Curtain and intermission</i>.</h5>
<hr class="tb" />


<blockquote>

<p><i>Same stage setting in early evening light. The
sentry on the battery is still visible through the
windows in the background. The laurel wreaths are
hung over the arms of an easy-chair. The hanging lamp
is lit. Faint music</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>, <i>pale and hollow-eyed, his hair
showing touches of gray, dressed in a worn undress
uniform, with riding-boots, sits at the writing-table
and plays solitaire. He wears his spectacles. The
entr'acte music continues after the curtain has been
raised and until another person enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>plays away at his solitaire, bid with
a sudden start now and then, when he looks up and
listens with evident alarm</i>.</p>

<p><i>He does not seem able to make the solitaire come
out, so he becomes impatient and gathers up the
cards. Then he goes to the left-hand window, opens
it, and throws out the cards. The window (of the
French type) remains open, rattling on its hinges</i>.</p>

<p><i>He goes over to the buffet, but is frightened by the
noise made by the window, so that he turns around
to see what it is. Takes out three dark-coloured
square whiskey bottles, examines them carefully&mdash;and
throws them out of the window. Takes out some boxes
of cigars, smells at one, and throws them out of the
window</i>.</p>

<p><i>Next he takes off his spectacles, cleans them
carefully, and tries how far he can see with them.
Then he throws them out of the window, stumbles
against the furniture as if he could not see,
and lights six candles in a candelabrum on the
chiffonier. Catches sight of the laurel wreaths,
picks them up, and goes toward the window, but turns
back. Folds the wreaths carefully in the piano
cover, fastens the corners together with pins taken
from the writing-table, and puts the bundle on a
chair. Goes to the piano, strikes the keyboard with
his fists, locks the piano, and throws the key out
through the window. Then he lights the candles on the
piano. Goes to the what-not, takes his wife's picture
from it, looks at this and tears it to pieces,
dropping the pieces on the floor. The window rattles
on its hinges, and again he becomes frightened</i>.</p>

<p><i>Then, after having calmed himself he takes the
pictures of his son and daughter, kisses them in an
off-hand way, and puts them into his pocket. All the
rest of the pictures he sweeps down with his elbow
and pokes together into a heap with his foot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Then he sits down at the writing-table, tired out,
and puts a hand up to his heart. Lights the candle
on the table and sighs; stares in front of himself
as if confronted with unpleasant visions. Rises and
goes over to the chiffonier, opens the lid, takes
out a bundle of letters tied together with a blue
silk ribbon, and throws the bundle into the fireplace
of the glazed brick oven. Closes the chiffonier.
The telegraph receiver sounds a single click. The</i>
<span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>shrinks together in deadly fear and stands
fixed to the spot, listening. But hearing nothing
more from the instrument, he turns to listen in
the direction of the door on the left. Goes over
and opens it, takes a step inside the doorway, and
returns, carrying on his arm a cat whose back he
strokes. Then he goes out to the right. Now the music
ceases</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>enters from the background, dressed in a
walking suit, with gloves and hat on; her hair is
black; she looks around with surprise at the many
lighted candles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>enters from the left, nervous</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It looks like Christmas Eve here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Holds out her hand for him to kiss</i>] Thank me! [<span class="small-c">CURT</span>
<i>kisses her hand unwillingly</i>] Six witnesses, and four of them
solid as rock. The report has been made, and the answer will
come here by telegraph&mdash;right here, into the heart of the
fortress.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You should say "thanks" instead of "so."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why has he lit so many candles?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Because he is afraid of the dark, of course. Look at the
telegraph key&mdash;does it not look like the handle of a coffee
mill? I grind, I grind, and the beans crack as when you pull
teeth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What has he been doing in the room here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It looks as if he intended to move. Down below, that's
where you are going to move!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Don't, Alice&mdash;I think it's distressing! He was the friend
of my youth, and he showed me kindness many times when I was in
difficulty&mdash;He should be pitied!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And how about me, who have done nothing wrong, and who
have had to sacrifice my career to that monster?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How about that career? Was it so very brilliant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Enraged</i>] What are you saying? Do you know who I am,
what I have been?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Now, now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Are you beginning already?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Already?</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>throws her arms around</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span><i>'s neck and
kisses him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>takes her by the arms and bites her neck so
that she screams</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You bite me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Beyond himself</i>] Yes, I want to bite your throat and
suck your blood like a lynx. You have aroused the wild beast
in me&mdash;that beast which I have tried for years to kill by
privations and self-inflicted tortures. I came here believing
myself a little better than you two, and now I am the vilest of
all. Since I first saw you&mdash;in all your odious nakedness&mdash;and
since my vision became warped by passion, I have known the full
strength of evil. What is ugly becomes beautiful; what is good
becomes ugly and mean&mdash;Come here and I'll choke you&mdash;with a
kiss! [<i>He locks her in his arms</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Holds up her left hand</i>] Behold the mark of the
shackles that you have broken. I was a slave, and you set me
free.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I am going to bind you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. For a moment I thought you were&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Pious?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, you prated about the fall of man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Did I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And I thought you had come here to preach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You thought so? In an hour we shall be in the city, and
then you shall see what I am&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then we will go to the theatre to-night, just to show
ourselves. The shame will be his if I run away, don't you see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I begin to understand that prison is not enough&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, it is not&mdash;there must be shame also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. A strange world! You commit a shameful act, and the shame
falls on him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, if the world be so stupid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It is as if these prison walls had absorbed all the
corruption of the criminals, and it gets into you if you merely
breathe this air. You were thinking of the theatre and the
supper, I suppose. I was thinking of my son.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Strikes him on the mouth with her glove</i>] Fogey!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>lifts his hand as if to strike her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Drawing back] Tout beau</i>!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes&mdash;on your knees! [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>kneels down</i>] Down on your
face! [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>touches the ground with his forehead</i>] Kiss my
foot! [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>kisses her foot</i>] And don't you ever do it again!
Get up!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Where have I landed? Where am I?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, you know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Looking around with horror</i>] I believe almost&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Enters from the right, looking wretched, leaning on a
cane</i>] Curt, may I have a talk with you&mdash;alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Is it about that departure in safety?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Sits down at the sewing-table</i>] Curt, will you kindly
sit down here by me a little while? And, Alice, will you please
grant me a moment&mdash;of peace!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What is up now? New signals! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Please be
seated. [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>sits down reluctantly</i>] And listen to the words
of age and wisdom&mdash;And if a telegram should come&mdash;tip me off!
[<i>Goes out to the left</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With dignity, after a pause</i>] Can you explain a fate
like mine, like ours?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No more than I can explain my own!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What can be the meaning of this jumble?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. In my better moments I have believed that just this was
the meaning&mdash;that we should not be able to catch a meaning, and
yet submit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Submit? Without a fixed point outside myself I cannot
submit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Quite right, but as a mathematician you should be able to
seek that unknown point when several known ones are given&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I have sought it, and&mdash;I have not found it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then you have made some mistake in your calculations&mdash;do
it all over again!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I should do it over again? Tell me, where did you get
your resignation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have none left. Don't overestimate me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. As you may have noticed, my understanding of the art of
living has been&mdash;elimination! That means: wipe out and pass on!
Very early in life I made myself a bag into which I chucked my
humiliations, and when it was full I dropped it into the sea.
I don't think any man ever suffered so many humiliations as I
have. But when I wiped them out and passed on they ceased to
exist.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have noticed that you have wrought both your life and
your environment out of your poetical imagination.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. How could I have lived otherwise? How could I have
endured? [<i>Puts his hand over his heart</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Poorly. [Pause] Then comes a moment when the faculty
for what you call poetical imagination gives out. And then
reality leaps forth in all its nakedness&mdash;It is frightful! [<i>He
is now speaking in a voice of lachrymose senility, and with
his lower jaw drooping</i>] Look here, my dear friend&mdash;[<i>controls
himself and speaks in his usual voice</i>] forgive me!&mdash;When I was
in the city and consulted the doctor [<i>now the tearful voice
returns</i>] he said that I was played out&mdash;[<i>in his usual voice</i>]
and that I couldn't live much longer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Was <i>that</i> what he said?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With tearful voice</i>] That's what he said!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So it was not true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What? Oh&mdash;no, that was not true. [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Was the rest of it not true either?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That my son was ordered to report here as cadet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I never heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you know&mdash;your ability to wipe out your own misdeeds is
miraculous!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't understand what you are talking of.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then you have come to the end!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, there is not much left!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Tell me, perhaps you never applied for that divorce which
would bring your wife into disgrace?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Divorce? No, I have not heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>, [<i>Rising</i>] Will you admit, then, that you have been lying?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You employ such strong words, my friend. All of us need
forbearance.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, you have come to see that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Firmly, with clear voice</i>] Yes, I have come to see
that&mdash;And for this reason, Curt, please forgive me! Forgive
everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That was a manly word! But I have nothing to forgive you.
And I am not the man you believe me to be. No longer now! Least
of all one worthy of receiving your confessions!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With clear voice</i>] Life seemed so peculiar&mdash;so
contrary, so malignant&mdash;ever since my childhood&mdash;and people
seemed so bad that I grew bad also&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>On his feet, perturbed, and glancing at the telegraph
instrument</i>] Is it possible to close off an instrument like that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Hardly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>With increasing alarm</i>] Who is Sergeant-Major Östberg?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. An honest fellow, but something of a busybody, I should
say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And who is the Quartermaster?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. He is my enemy, of course, but I have nothing bad to
say of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Looking out through the window, where a lantern is seen
moving to and fro</i>] What are they doing with the lantern out on
the battery?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Do you see a lantern?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and people moving about.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I suppose it is what we call a service squad.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What is that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. A few men and a corporal. Probably some poor wretch
that has to be locked up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Now, when you know Alice, how do you like her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I cannot tell&mdash;I have no understanding of people at all.
She is as inexplicable to me as you are, or as I am myself. For
I am reaching the age when wisdom makes this acknowledgment:
I know nothing, I understand nothing; But when I observe an
action, I like to get at the motive behind it. Why did you push
her into the water?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't know. It merely seemed quite natural to me, as
she was standing on the pier, that she ought to be in the water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you ever regretted it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Never!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's strange!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Of course, it is! So strange that I cannot realise that
I am the man who has been guilty of such a mean act.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you not expected her to take some revenge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, she seems to have taken it in full measure; and
that, too, seems no less natural to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What has so suddenly brought you to this cynical
resignation?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Since I looked death in the face, life has presented
itself from a different viewpoint. Tell me, if you were to judge
between Alice and myself, whom would you place in the right?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Neither of you. But to both of you I should give endless
compassion&mdash;perhaps a little more of it to you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Give me your hand, Curt!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Gives him one hand and puts the other one on the</i>
<span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>'S <i>shoulder</i>] Old boy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>In from the left, carrying a sunshade</i>] Well, how
harmonious! Oh, friendship! Has there been no telegram yet?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Coldly</i>] No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. This delay makes me impatient, and when I grow impatient
I push matters along&mdash;Look, Curt, how I give him the final
bullet. And now he'll bite the grass! First, I load&mdash;I know
all about rifle practice, the famous rifle practice of which
less than 5,000 copies were sold&mdash;and then I aim&mdash;fire! [<i>She
takes aim with her sunshade</i>] How is your new wife? The young,
beautiful, unknown one? You don't know! But I know how my
lover is doing. [<i>Puts her arms around the neck of</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>and
kisses him; he thrusts her away from himself</i>] He is well,
although still a little bashful! You wretch, whom I have never
loved&mdash;you, who were too conceited to be jealous&mdash;you never saw
how I was leading you by the nose!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Good-bye! [<i>Goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>With a sudden change of attitude</i>] The wretch! That's a
friend for you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Softly</i>] Forgive me, Alice, and come here&mdash;come quick!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Over to the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] That's the worst rascal and
hypocrite I have met in my life! Do you know, you are a man

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The doctor has said so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then there was no truth in the rest either?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>In despair</i>] Oh, what have I done!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. There is help for everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, this is beyond helping!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Nothing is beyond helping, if you only wipe it out and
pass on.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But the telegram&mdash;the telegram!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Which telegram?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>On her knees beside the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] Are we then cast
out? Must this happen? I have sprung a mine under myself, under
us. Why did you have to tell untruths? And why should that man
come here to tempt me? We are lost! Your magnanimity might have
helped everything, forgiven everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What is it that cannot be forgiven? What is it that I
have not already forgiven you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You are right&mdash;but there is no help for this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I cannot guess it, although I know your ingenuity when
it comes to villanies&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, if I could only get out of this, I should care for
you&mdash;I should love you, Edgar!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Listen to me! Where do I stand?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't you think anybody can help us&mdash;well, no man can!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Who could then help?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Looking the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>straight in the eye</i>] I don't
know&mdash;Think of it, what is to become of the children with their
name dishonoured&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have you dishonoured that name?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Not I! Not I! And then they must leave school! And as
they go out into the world, they will be lonely as we, and cruel
as we&mdash;Then you didn't meet Judith either, I understand now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, but wipe it out!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The telegraph receiver clicks</i>. <span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>flies up</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [Screams] Now ruin is overtaking us! [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>]
Don't listen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Quietly</i>] I am not going to listen, dear child&mdash;just
calm yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Standing by the instrument, raises herself on tiptoe
in order to look out through the window</i>] Don't listen! Don't
listen!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Holding his hands over his ears</i>] Lisa, child, I am
stopping up my ears.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>On her knees, with lifted hands</i>] God, help us! The
squad is coming&mdash;[<i>Weeping and sobbing</i>] God in heaven!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>She appears to be moving her lips as if in silent
prayer</i>.</p>

<p><i>The telegraph receiver continues to click for a
while and a long white strip of paper seems to crawl
out of the instrument. Then complete silence prevails
once more</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Rises, tears off the paper strip, and reads it in
silence. Then she turns her eyes upward for a moment. Goes over
to the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>and kisses him on the forehead</i>] That is over
now! It was nothing!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Sits down in the other chair, puts her handkerchief
to her face, and breaks into a violent spell of
weeping</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What kind of secrets are these?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't ask! It is over now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. AS you please, child.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You would not have spoken like that three days ago&mdash;what
has done it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, dear, when I fell down that first time, I went a
little way on the other side of the grave. What I saw has been
forgotten, but the impression of it still remains.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And it was?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. A hope&mdash;for something better!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Something better?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes. That this could be the real life, I have, in fact,
never believed: it is death&mdash;or something still worse!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have probably been set to torment each other&mdash;so it
seems at least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have we tormented each other enough?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, I think so! And upset things! [<i>Looks around</i>]
Suppose we put things to rights? And clean house?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, if it can be done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Gets up to survey the room</i>] It can't be done in one
day&mdash;no, it can't!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In two, then! Many days!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Let us hope so! [<i>Pause. Sits down again</i>] So you
didn't get free this time after all! But then, you didn't get
me locked up either! [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>looks staggered</i>] Yes, I know you
wanted to put me in prison, but I wipe it out. I suppose you
have done worse than that&mdash;[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>is speechless</i>] And I was
innocent of those defalcations.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And now you intend me to become your nurse?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. If you are willing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What else could I do?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I don't know!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Sits down, numbed and crushed</i>] These are the eternal
torments! Is there, then, no end to them?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, if we are patient. Perhaps life begins when death
comes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. If it were so! [<i>Pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You think Curt a hypocrite?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Of course I do!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And I don't! But all who come near us turn evil and
go their way. Curt was weak, and the evil is strong! [<i>Pause</i>]
How commonplace life has become! Formerly blows were struck;
now you shake your fist at the most! I am fairly certain
that, three months from now, we shall celebrate our silver
wedding&mdash;with Curt as best man&mdash;and with the Doctor and Gerda
among the guests. The Quartermaster will make the speech and
the Sergeant-Major will lead the cheering. And if I know the
Colonel right, he will come on his own invitation&mdash;Yes, you may
laugh! But do you recall the silver wedding of Adolph&mdash;in the
Fusiliers? The bride had to carry her wedding ring on the right
hand, because the groom in a tender moment had chopped off her
left ring finger with his dirk. [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>puts her handkerchief
to her mouth in order to repress her laughter</i>] Are you crying?
No, I believe you are laughing! Yes, child, partly we weep and
partly we laugh. Which is the right thing to do?&mdash;Don't ask
me! The other day I read in a newspaper that a man had been
divorced seven times&mdash;which means that he had been married seven
times&mdash;and finally, at the age of ninety-eight, he ran away with
his first wife and married her again. Such is love! If life be
serious, or merely a joke, is more than I can decide. Often it
is most painful when a joke, and its seriousness is after all
more agreeable and peaceful. But when at last you try to be
serious, somebody comes and plays a joke on you&mdash;as Curt, for
instance! Do you want a silver wedding? [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>remains silent</i>]
Oh, say yes! They will laugh at us, but what does it matter? We
may laugh also, or keep serious, as the occasion may require.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, all right!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Silver wedding, then! [<i>Rising</i>] Wipe out and pass on!
Therefore, let us pass on!</p>

<p><i>A rectangular drawing-room in white and gold.
The rear wall is broken by severed French windows
reaching down to the floor. These stand open,
revealing a garden terrace outside. Along this
terrace, serving as a public promenade, runs a stone
balustrade, on which are ranged pots of blue and
white faience, with petunias and scarlet geraniums
in them. Beyond, in the background, can be seen the
shore battery with a sentry pacing back and forth. In
the far distance, the open sea</i>.</p>

<p><i>At the left of the drawing-room stands a sofa
with gilded wood-work. In front of it are a table
and chairs. At the right is a grand piano, a
writing-table, and an open fireplace</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the foreground, an American easy-chair</i>.</p>

<p><i>By the writing-table is a standing lamp of copper
with a table attached to it</i>.</p>

<p><i>On the walls are severed old-fashioned oil
paintings</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>is sitting at the writing-table, engrossed
in some mathematical problem</i>. <span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>enters from
the background, in summer dress, short skirt, hair
in a braid down her back, hat in one hand and tennis
racket in the other. She stops in the doorway</i>. <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>
<i>rises, serious and respectful</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>In serious but friendly tone</i>] Why don't you come and
play tennis?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Bashful, struggling with his emotion</i>] I am very
busy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Didn't you see that I had made my bicycle point toward
the oak, and not away from it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, I saw it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Well, what does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. It means&mdash;that you want me to come and play tennis&mdash;but
my duty&mdash;I have some problems to work out&mdash;and your father is a
rather exacting teacher&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Do you like him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, I do. He takes such interest in all his pupils&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. He takes an interest in everything and everybody. Won't
you come?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You know I should like to&mdash;but I must not!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I'll ask papa to give you leave.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Don't do that. It will only cause talk.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Don't you think I can manage him? He wants what I want.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I suppose that is because you are so hard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You should be hard also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't belong to the wolf family.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Then you are a sheep.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Rather that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Tell me why you don't want to come and play tennis?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You know it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Tell me anyhow. The Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, you don't care for me at all, but you cannot enjoy
yourself with the Lieutenant unless I am present, so you can see
me suffer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Am I as cruel as that? I didn't know it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Well, now you know it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Then I shall do better hereafter, for I don't want to be
cruel, I don't want to be bad&mdash;in your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You say this only to fasten your hold on me. I am already
your slave, but it does not satisfy you. The slave must be
tortured and thrown to the wild beasts. You have already that
other fellow in your clutches&mdash;what do you want with me then?
Let me go my own way, and you can go yours.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Do you send me away? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>does not answer</i>] Then I
go! As second cousins, we shall have to meet now and then, but I
am not going to bother you any longer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>sits down at the table and returns to his
problem</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Instead of going away, comes down the stage and
approaches gradually the table where</i> <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>is sitting</i>] Don't
be afraid, I am going at once&mdash;I wanted only to see how the
Master of Quarantine lives&mdash;[<i>Looks around</i>] White and gold&mdash;a
Bechstein grand&mdash;well, well! We are still in the fort since
papa was pensioned&mdash;in the tower where mamma has been kept
twenty-five years&mdash;and we are there on sufferance at that.
You&mdash;you are rich&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Calmly</i>] We are not rich.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. So you say, but you are always wearing fine clothes
&mdash;but whatever you wear, for that matter, is becoming to you. Do
you hear what I say? [<i>Drawing nearer</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Submissively</i>] I do.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. How can you hear when you keep on figuring, or whatever
you are doing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't use my eyes to listen with.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Your eyes&mdash;have you ever looked at them in the mirror?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Go away!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You despise me, do you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Why, girl, I am not thinking of you at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Still nearer</i>] Archimedes is deep in his figures when
the soldier comes and cuts him down.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Stirs his papers about with the racket</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Don't touch my papers!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. That's what Archimedes said also. Now you are thinking
something foolish&mdash;you are thinking that I can not live without
you&mdash;-</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Why can't you leave me alone?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Be courteous, and I'll help you with your
examinations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Yes, I know the examiners&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Sternly</i>] And what of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Don't you know that one should stand well with the
teachers?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Do you mean your father and the Lieutenant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. And the Colonel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. And then you mean that your protection would enable me to
shirk my work?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You are a bad translator&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Of a bad original&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Be ashamed!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. So I am&mdash;both on your behalf and my own! I am ashamed of
having listened to you&mdash;Why don't you go?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Because I know you appreciate my company&mdash;Yes, you
manage always to pass by my window. You have always some errand
that brings you into the city with the same boat that I take.
You cannot go for a sail without having me to look after the jib.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. But a young girl shouldn't say that kind of things!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Do you mean to say that I am a child?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Sometimes you are a good child, and sometimes a bad
woman. Me you seem to have picked to be your sheep.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You are a sheep, and that's why I am going to protect
you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] The wolf makes a poor shepherd! You want to
eat me&mdash;that is the secret of it, I suppose. You want to put
your beautiful eyes in pawn to get possession of my head.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Oh, you have been looking at my eyes? I didn't expect
that much courage of you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>collects his papers and starts to go out
toward the right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>places herself in front of the door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Get out of my way, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Or?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. If you were a boy&mdash;bah! But you are a girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. And then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. If you had any pride at all, you would be gone, as you
may regard yourself as shown the door.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I'll get back at you for that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't doubt it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Goes enraged toward the background</i>]
I&mdash;shall-get&mdash;back&mdash;at you for that! [<i>Goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters from the left</i>] Where are you going, Allan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Oh, is that you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Who was it that left in such hurry&mdash;so that the bushes
shook?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. It was Judith.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. She is a little impetuous, but a fine girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. When a girl is cruel and rude, she is always said to be a
fine girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Don't be so severe, Allan! Are you not satisfied with your
new relatives?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I like Uncle Edgar&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, he has many good sides. How about your other
teachers&mdash;the Lieutenant, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. He's so uncertain. Sometimes he seems to have a grudge
against me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, no! You just go here and make people "seem" this or
that. Don't brood, but look after your own affairs, do what is
proper, and leave others to their own concerns.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. So I do, but&mdash;they won't leave me alone. They pull you
in&mdash;as the cuttlefish down at the landing&mdash;they don't bite, but
they stir up vortices that suck&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You have some tendency to melancholia, I think. Don't you
feel at home here with me? Is there anything you miss?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I have never been better off, but&mdash;there is something
here that smothers me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Here by the sea? Are you not fond of the sea?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, the open sea. But along the shores you find
eelgrass, cuttlefish, jellyfish, sea-nettles, or whatever they
are called.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You shouldn't stay indoors so much. Go out and play tennis.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Oh, that's no fun!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You are angry with Judith, I guess?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You are so exacting toward people&mdash;it is not wise, for
then you become isolated.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I am not exacting, but&mdash;It feels as if I were lying at
the bottom of a pile of wood and had to wait my turn to get into
the fire&mdash;and it weighs on me&mdash;all that is above weighs me down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Bide your turn. The pile grows smaller&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, but so slowly, so slowly. And in the meantime I lie
here and grow mouldy.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It is not pleasant to be young. And yet you young ones are
envied.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Are we? Would you change?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, thanks!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Do you know what is worse than anything else? It is to
sit still and keep silent while the old ones talk nonsense&mdash;I
know that I am better informed than they on some matters&mdash;and
yet I must keep silent. Well, pardon me, I am not counting you
among the old.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Perhaps because we have only just now become
acquainted&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And because&mdash;your ideas of me have undergone a change?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. During the years we were separated, I suppose you didn't
always think of me in a friendly way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Did you ever see a picture of me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. One, and it was very unfavourable.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And old-looking?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Ten years ago my hair turned gray in a single night&mdash;it
has since then resumed its natural color without my doing
anything for it&mdash;Let us talk of something else! There comes your
aunt&mdash;my cousin. How do you like her?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't want to tell!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I shall not ask you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Enters dressed in a very light-colored walking-suit and

we have a right to forget&mdash;what has never been.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Forget it then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. However&mdash;I don't think <i>he</i> has forgotten&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You are thinking of that night when his heart gave out
and he fell on the floor&mdash;and when you rejoiced too quickly,
thinking him already dead?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes. Since then he has recovered; but when he gave up
drinking, he learned to keep silent, and now he is terrible. He
is up to something that I cannot make out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Your husband, Alice, is a harmless fool who has shown me
all sorts of kindnesses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Beware of his kindnesses. I know them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He has then blinded you also? Can you not see the danger?
Don't you notice the snares?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then your ruin is certain.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, mercy!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Think only, I have to sit here and see disaster stalking
you like a cat&mdash;I point at it, but you cannot see it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Allan, with his unspoiled vision, cannot see it either. He
sees nothing but Judith, for that matter, and this seems to me a
safeguard of our good relationship.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. A flirtatious little thing, with a braid down her back and
rather too short skirts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Exactly! But the other day I saw her dressed up in long
skirts&mdash;and then she was a young lady&mdash;and not so very young
either, when her hair was put up.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. She is somewhat precocious, I admit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And she is playing with Allan.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's all right, so long as it remains play.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. So <i>that</i> is all right?&mdash;Now Edgar will be here soon, and
he will take the easy-chair&mdash;he loves it with such passion that
he could steal it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why, he can have it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Let him sit over there, and we'll stay here. And when he
talks&mdash;he is always talkative in the morning&mdash;when he talks of
insignificant things, I'll translate them for you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, my dear Alice, you are too deep, far too deep. What
could I have to fear as long as I look after my quarantine
properly and otherwise behave decently?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You believe in justice and honour and all that sort of
thing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and it is what experience has taught me. Once I
believed the very opposite&mdash;and paid dearly for it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now he's coming!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have never seen you so frightened before.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. My bravery was nothing but ignorance of the danger.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Danger? Soon you'll have me frightened too!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, if I only could&mdash;There!</p>

He greets them with a nod and goes straight to the
easy-chair, where he sits down</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Let him speak first.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. This is a splendid chair you have here, dear Curt;
perfectly splendid.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I'll give it to you, if you will accept it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That was not what I meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I mean it seriously. How much have I not received from
you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Garrulously</i>] Oh, nonsense! And when I sit here, I
can overlook the whole island, all the walks; I can see all the
people on their verandahs, all the ships on the sea, that are
coming in and going out. You have really happened on the best
piece of this island, which is certainly not an island of the
blessed. Or what do you say, Alice? Yes, they call it "Little
Hell," and here Curt has built himself a paradise, but without
an Eve, of course, for when she appeared, then the paradise came
to an end. I say&mdash;do you know that this was a royal hunting
lodge?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So I have heard.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You live royally, you, but, if I may say so myself, you
have me to thank for it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] There&mdash;now he wants to steal you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have to thank you for a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Fudge! Tell me, did you get the wine cases?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And you are satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Quite satisfied, and you may tell your dealer so.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. His goods are always prime quality&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] At second-rate prices, and you have to pay
the difference.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What did you say, Alice?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I? Nothing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, when this quarantine station was about to be
established, I had in mind applying for the position&mdash;and so I
made a study of quarantine methods.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Now he's lying!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Boastfully</i>] And I did not share the antiquated
ideas concerning disinfection which were then accepted by the
government. For I placed myself on the side of the Neptunists
&mdash;so called because they emphasise the use of water&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Beg your pardon, but I remember distinctly that it was I
who preached water, and you fire, at that time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I? Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Aloud</i>] Yes, I remember that, too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I remember it so much the better because&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Cutting him short</i>] Well, it's possible, but it does
not matter. [<i>Raising his voice</i>] However&mdash;we have now reached
a point where a new state of affairs&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>, <i>who wants to
interrupt</i>] just a moment!&mdash;has begun to prevail&mdash;and when the
methods of quarantining are about to become revolutionized.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. By the by, do you know who is writing those stupid
articles in that periodical?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Flushing</i>] No, I don't know, but why do you call them
stupid?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Look out! It is he who writes them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He?&mdash;[<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] Not very well advised, at least.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, are you the man to judge of that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Are we going to have a quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is hard to keep peace on this island, but we ought
to set a good example&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, can you explain this to me? When I came here I made
friends with all the officials and became especially intimate
with the regimental auditor&mdash;as intimate as men are likely to
become at our age. And then, in a little while&mdash;it was shortly
after your recovery&mdash;one after another began to grow cold toward
me&mdash;and yesterday the auditor avoided me on the promenade. I
cannot tell you how it hurt me! [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span> <i>remains silent</i>]
Have you noticed any ill-feeling toward yourself?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, on the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Don't you understand that he has been
stealing your friends?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] I wondered whether it might have
anything to do with this new stock issue to which I refused to
subscribe.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, no&mdash;But can you tell me why you didn't subscribe?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Because I have already put my small savings into your soda
factory. And also because a new issue means that the old stock
is shaky.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Preoccupied</i>] That's a splendid lamp you have. Where
did you get it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. In the city, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Look out for your lamp!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] You must not think that I am ungrateful
or distrustful, Edgar.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, but it shows small confidence to withdraw from an
undertaking which you have helped to start.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why, ordinary prudence bids everybody save himself and
what is his.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Save? Is there any danger then? Do you think anybody
wants to rob you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Why such sharp words?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Were you not satisfied when I helped you to place your
money at six per cent.?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and even grateful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You are not grateful&mdash;it is not in your nature, but
this you cannot help.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Listen to him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. My nature has shortcomings enough, and my struggle
against them has not been very successful, but I do recognise
obligations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Show it then! [<i>Reaches out his hand to pick up a
newspaper</i>] Why, what is this? A death notice? [<i>Reads</i>] The
Health Commissioner is dead.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Now he is speculating in the corpse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>As if to himself</i>] This is going to bring about
certain&mdash;changes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. In what respect?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] That remains to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>] Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I think I'll have to go to the city&mdash;[<i>Catches sight of
a letter on the writing-table, picks it up as if unconsciously,
reads the address, and puts it back</i>] Oh, I hope you will pardon
my absent-mindedness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No harm done.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Why, that's Allan's drawing case. Where is the boy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He is out playing with the girls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That big boy? I don't like it. And Judith must not be
running about like that. You had better keep an eye on your
young gentleman, and I'll look after my young lady. [<i>Goes over
to the piano and strikes a few notes</i>] Splendid tone in this
instrument. A Steinbech, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. A Bechstein.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, you are well fixed. Thank me for bringing you here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] He lies, for he tried to keep you away.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, good-bye for a while. I am going to take the next
boat.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Scrutinises the paintings on the walls as he goes
out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I can't see through his plans yet. But&mdash;tell me one
thing. This envelope he looked at&mdash;from whom is the letter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am sorry to admit&mdash;it was my one secret.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And he ferreted it out. Can you see that he knows
witchery, as I have told you before? Is there anything printed
on the envelope?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes&mdash;"The Citizens' Union."</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Then he has guessed your secret. You want to get into
the Riksdag, I suppose. And now you'll see that he goes there
instead of you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Has he ever thought of it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, but he is thinking of it now. I read it on his face
while he was looking at the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's why he has to go to the city?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, he made up his mind to go when he read the death
notice.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What has he to gain by the death of the Health
Commissioner?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Hard to tell! Perhaps the man was an enemy who had stood
in the way of his plans.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. If he be as terrible as you say, then there is reason to
fear him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Didn't you hear how he wanted to steal you, to tie your
hands by means of pretended obligations that do not exist? For
instance, he has done nothing to get you this position, but has,
on the contrary, tried to keep you out of it. He is a man-thief,
an insect, one of those wood-borers that eat up your insides so
that one day you find yourself as hollow as a dying pine tree.
He hates you, although he is bound to you by the memory of your
youthful friendship&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How keen-witted we are made by our hatreds!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And stupid by our loves&mdash;blind and stupid!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, no, don't say that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know what is meant by a vampire? They say it is
the soul of a dead person seeking a body in which it may live
as a parasite. Edgar is dead&mdash;ever since he fell down on the
floor that time. You see, he has no interests of his own, no
personality, no initiative. But if he can only get hold of some
other person he hangs on to him, sends down roots into him, and
begins to flourish and blossom. Now he has fastened himself on
you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. If he comes too close I'll shake him off.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Try to shake off a burr! Listen: do you know why he does
not want Judith and Allan to play?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I suppose he is concerned about their feelings.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Not at all. He wants to marry Judith to&mdash;the Colonel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Shocked</i>] That old widower!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Horrible! And Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. If she could get the General, who is eighty, she would
take him in order to bully the Colonel, who is sixty. To bully,
you know, that's the aim of her life. To trample down and
bully&mdash;there you have the motto of <i>that</i> family.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Can this be Judith? That maiden fair and proud and
splendid?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, I know all about that! May I sit here and write a
letter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Puts the writing-table in order</i>] With pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Takes off her gloves and sits down at the
writing-table</i>] Now we'll try our hand at the art of war. I
failed once when I tried to slay my dragon. But now I have
mastered the trade.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you know that it is necessary to load before you fire?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, and with ball cartridges at that!</p>

not be afraid of me, Allan&mdash;I am not dangerous to you&mdash;What is
wrong? Are you sick?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In what way?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have you a headache?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And your chest? Pain?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Pain&mdash;pain&mdash;as if your heart wanted to melt away. And it
pulls, pulls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And then you wish to die&mdash;that you were already
dead&mdash;and everything seems so hard. And you can only think of
one thing&mdash;always the same&mdash;but if two are thinking of the
same thing, then sorrow falls heavily on one of them. [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>
<i>forgets himself and begins to pick at the handkerchief</i>]
That's the sickness which no one can cure. You cannot eat
and you cannot drink; you want only to weep, and you weep so
bitterly&mdash;especially out in the woods where nobody can see you,
for at that kind of sorrow all men laugh&mdash;men who are so cruel!
Dear me! What do you want of her? Nothing! You don't want to
kiss her mouth, for you feel that you would die if you did. When
your thoughts run to her, you feel as if death were approaching.
And it is death, child&mdash;that sort of death&mdash;which brings life.
But you don't understand it yet! I smell violets&mdash;it is herself.
[<i>Steps closer to</i> <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>and takes the handkerchief gently away
from him.</i>] It is she, it is she everywhere, none but she!
Oh, oh, oh! [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>cannot help burying his face in</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>'s
<i>bosom</i>] Poor boy! Poor boy! Oh, how it hurts, how it hurts!
[<i>Wipes off his tears with the handkerchief</i>] There, there! Cry
&mdash;cry to your heart's content. There now! Then the heart grows
lighter&mdash;But now, Allan, rise up and be a man, or she will not
look at you&mdash;she, the cruel one, who is not cruel. Has she
tormented you? With the Lieutenant? You must make friends with
the Lieutenant, so that you two can talk of her. That gives a
little ease also.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't want to see the Lieutenant!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now look here, little boy, it won't be long before the
Lieutenant seeks you out in order to get a chance to talk of
her. For&mdash;[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>looks up with a ray of hope on his face</i>]
Well, shall I be nice and tell you? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>droops his head</i>] He
is just as unhappy as you are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Happy</i>] No?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, indeed, and he needs somebody to whom he may
unburden his heart when Judith has wounded him. You seem to
rejoice in advance?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Does she not want the Lieutenant?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. She does not want you either, dear boy, for she wants
the Colonel. [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>is saddened again</i>] Is it raining again?
Well, the handkerchief you cannot have, for Judith <i>is</i> careful
about her belongings and wants her dozen complete. [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>looks

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Slyly</i>] It always calms down about dinner-time,
and&mdash;that's the time Miss Judith has her lesson.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. [<i>Sadly</i>] Oh, yes, yes! Hm! Do you think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Would one of you young gentlemen care to deliver a
letter for me? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>exchange glances of
mutual distrust</i>]&mdash;to Miss Judith? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>
<i>jump up and hasten over to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>, <i>but not without a certain
dignity meant to disguise their emotion</i>] Both of you? Well, the
more safely my errand will be attended to. [<i>Hands the letter
to the</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>] If you please, Lieutenant, I should like
to have that handkerchief. My daughter is very careful about
her things&mdash;there is a touch of pettiness in her nature&mdash;Give
me that handkerchief! I don't wish to laugh at you, but you
must not make yourself ridiculous&mdash;needlessly. And the Colonel
does not like to play the part of an Othello. [<i>Takes the
handkerchief</i>] Away with you now, young men, and try to hide
your feelings as much as you can.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>bows and goes out, followed closely
by</i> <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Calls out</i>] Allan!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Stops unwillingly in the doorway</i>] Yes, Aunt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Stay here, unless you want to inflict more suffering on
yourself than you can bear.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. But he is going!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Let him burn himself. But take care of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't want to take care of myself.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And then you cry afterward. And so I get the trouble of
consoling you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I want to go!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Go then! But come back here, young madcap, and I'll have
the right to laugh at you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>runs after the</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>.</p>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>writes again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters</i>] Alice, I have received an anonymous letter that
is bothering me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Have you noticed that Edgar has become another person
since he put off the uniform? I could never have believed that a
coat might make such a difference.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You didn't answer my question.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It was no question. It was a piece of information. What
do you fear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Everything!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He went to the city. And his trips to the city are always
followed by something dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I can do nothing because I don't know from which
quarter the attack will begin.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Folding the letter</i>] We'll see whether I have guessed
it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Will you help me then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes&mdash;but no further than my own interests permit. My
own&mdash;that is my children's.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I understand that! Do you hear how silent everything
is&mdash;here on land, out on the sea, everywhere?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But behind the silence I hear voices&mdash;mutterings, cries!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Hush! I hear something, too&mdash;no, it was only the gulls.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But I hear something else! And now I am going to the
post-office&mdash;with this letter!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Can I borrow your wrench?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Without looking up</i>] No, you cannot.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You are discourteous now, because you think I am running
after you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Without crossness</i>] I am nothing at all, but I ask
merely to be left alone.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Comes nearer</i>] Allan!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You mustn't be angry with me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I am not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Will you give me your hand on that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Kindly</i>] I don't want to shake hands with you, but I am
not angry&mdash;What do you want with me anyhow?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Oh, but you're stupid!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Well, let it go at that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You think me cruel, and nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. No, for I know that you are kind too&mdash;you <i>can</i> be kind!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Well&mdash;how can I help&mdash;that you and the Lieutenant run
around and weep in the woods? Tell me, why do you weep? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>
<i>is embarrassed</i>] Tell me now&mdash;I never weep. And why have you
become such good friends? Of what do you talk while you are
walking about arm in arm? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>cannot answer</i>] Allan, you'll
soon see what kind I am and whether I can strike a blow for one
I like. And I want to give you a piece of advice&mdash;although I
have no use for tale-bearing. Be prepared!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. For what?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. From what quarter?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. From the quarter where you least expect it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Well, I am rather used to disappointment, and life has
not brought me much that was pleasant What's in store now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Pensively</i>] You poor boy&mdash;give me your hand! [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>
<i>gives her his hand</i>] Look at me! Don't you dare to look at me?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>rushes out to the left in order to hide his
emotion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. [<i>In from the background</i>] I beg your pardon! I
thought that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Tell me, Lieutenant, will you be my friend and ally?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. If you'll do me the honour&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Yes&mdash;a word only&mdash;don't desert Allan when disaster
overtakes him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. What disaster?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You'll soon see&mdash;this very day perhaps. Do you like
Allan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. The young man is my best pupil, and I value him
personally also on account of his strength of character&mdash;Yes,
life has moments when strength is required [<i>with emphasis</i>] to
bear up, to endure, to suffer, in a word!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. That was more than one word, I should say. However, you
like Allan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Look him up then, and keep him company.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. It was for that purpose I came here&mdash;for that and no
other. I had no other object in my visit.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I had not supposed anything of that kind&mdash;of the kind
you mean! Allan went that way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Pointing to the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. [<i>Goes reluctantly to the left</i>] Yes&mdash;I'll do what
you ask.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Do, please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>In from the background</i>] What are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I wanted to borrow a wrench.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Will you listen to me a moment?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Of course, I will.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>sits down on the sofa.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Remains standing</i>] But tell me quickly what you want
to say. I don't like long lectures.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Lectures? Well, then&mdash;put up your hair and put on a long
dress.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Because you are no longer a child. And you are young
enough to need no coquetry about your age.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That you have reached marriageable age. And your way of
dressing is causing scandal.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Then I shall do what you say.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You have understood then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And we are agreed?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. On all points?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Even the tenderest!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Will you at the same time cease playing&mdash;with Allan?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. It is going to be serious then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Then we may just as well begin at once.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She has already laid aside the handle-bars. Now she lets down
the bicycle skirt and twists her braid into a knot which she
fastens on top of her head with a hair-pin taken out of her
mother's hair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It is not proper to make your toilet in a strange place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Am I all right this way? Then I am ready. Come now who
dares!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Now at last you look decent. And leave Allan in peace
after this.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I don't understand what you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Can't you see that he is suffering?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Yes, I think I have noticed it, but I don't know why. I
don't suffer!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That is <i>your</i> strength. But the day will come&mdash;oh,
yes, you shall know what it means. Go home now, and don't
forget&mdash;that you are wearing a long skirt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Must you walk differently then?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Just try.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Tries to walk like a lady</i>] Oh, my feet are tied; I am
caught, I cannot run any longer!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, child, now the walking begins, along the slow road
toward the unknown, which you know already, but must pretend to
ignore. Shorter steps, and much slower&mdash;much slower! The low
shoes of childhood must go, Judith, and you have to wear boots.
You don't remember when you laid aside baby socks and put on
shoes, but I do!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I can never stand this!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And yet you must&mdash;must!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Goes over to her mother and kisses her lightly on the
cheek; then walks out with the dignified bearing of a lady, but
forgetting the handle-bars</i>] Good-bye then!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters from the right</i>] So you're already here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Has <i>he</i> come back?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How did he appear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. In full dress&mdash;so he has called on the Colonel. And he
wore two orders.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Two? I knew he was to receive the Order of the Sword on
his retirement. But what can the other one be?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I am not very familiar with those things, but there was a
white cross within a red one.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It is a Portuguese order then. Let me see&mdash;tell me, didn't
his articles in that periodical deal with quarantine stations in
Portuguese harbours?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, as far as I can recall.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And he has never been in Portugal?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Never.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I have been there.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You shouldn't be so communicative. His ears and his
memory are so good.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Don't you think Judith may have helped him to this honour?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well, I declare! There are limits&mdash;[rising] and you have
passed them.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are we to quarrel now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That depends on you. Don't meddle with my interests.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. If they cross my own, I have to meddle with them, although
with a careful hand. Here he comes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And now it is going to happen.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What is&mdash;going to happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. We shall see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Let it come to open attack then, for this state of siege
is getting on my nerves. I have not a friend left on the island.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Wait a minute! You sit on this side&mdash;he must have the
easy-chair, of course&mdash;and then I can prompt you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Enters from the background, in full dress uniform,
wearing the Order of the Sword and the Portuguese Order of
Christ</i>] Good day! Here's the meeting place.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You are tired&mdash;sit down. [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>, <i>contrary
to expectation, takes a seat on the sofa to the left</i>] Make
yourself comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. This is all right. You're too kind.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Be careful&mdash;he's suspicious of us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Crossly</i>] What was that you said?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] He must have been drinking.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rudely</i>] No-o, he has not. [<i>Silence</i>] Well&mdash;how have
you been amusing yourselves?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Are you looking at my orders?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No-o!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I guess not, because you are jealous&mdash;Other-wise it is
customary to offer congratulations to the recipient of honours.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. We congratulate you.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. We get things like these instead of laurel wreaths,
such as they give to actresses.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That's for the wreaths at home on the walls of the
tower&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Which your brother gave you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, how you talk!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Before which I have had to bow down these twenty-five
years&mdash;and which it has taken me twenty-five years to expose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You have seen my brother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Rather! [Alice <i>is crushed. Silence</i>] And you,
Curt&mdash;you don't say anything, do you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am waiting.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, I suppose you know the big news?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It is not exactly agreeable for me to be the one who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, speak up!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The soda factory has gone to the wall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's decidedly unpleasant! Where does that leave you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I am all right, as I sold out in time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That was sensible.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But how about you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Done for!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It's your own fault. You should have sold out in time,
or taken new stock.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. So that I could lose that too.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, for then the company would have been all right.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not the company, but the directors, for in my mind that
new subscription was simply a collection for the benefit of the
board.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And now I ask whether such a view of the matter will
save your money?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, I shall have to give up everything.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Everything?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Even my home, the furniture&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But that's dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have experienced worse things. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. That's what happens when amateurs want to speculate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You surprise me, for you know very well that if I
had not subscribed, I should have been boycotted. The
supplementary livelihood of the coast population, toilers
of the sea, inexhaustible capital, inexhaustible as the sea
itself&mdash;philanthropy and national prosperity&mdash;Thus you wrote and
printed&mdash;And now you speak of it as speculation!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Unmoved</i>] What are you going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have an auction, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You had better.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What I said! For there [<i>slowly</i>] are going to be some
changes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. On the island?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes&mdash;as, for instance,&mdash;your quarters are going to be
exchanged for somewhat simpler ones.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, well.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, the plan is to place the quarantine station on the
outside shore, near the water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. My original idea!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Dryly</i>] I don't know about that&mdash;for I am not
familiar with your ideas on the subject. However it seems then
quite natural that you dispose of the furniture, and it will
attract much less notice&mdash;the scandal!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The scandal! [<i>Egging himself on</i>] For it is a scandal
to come to a new place and immediately get into financial
troubles which must result in a lot of annoyance to the
relatives&mdash;particularly to the relatives.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, I guess I'll have to bear the worst of it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I'll tell you one thing, my dear Curt: if I had not
stood by you in this matter, you would have lost your position.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That too?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It comes rather hard for you to keep things in
order&mdash;complaints have been made against your work.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Warranted complaints?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yah! For you are&mdash;in spite of your other respectable
qualities&mdash;a careless fellow&mdash;Don't interrupt me! You are a very
careless fellow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. How strange!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. However&mdash;the suggested change is going to take place
very soon. And I should advise you to hold the auction at once
or sell privately.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Privately? And where could I find a buyer in this place?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, I hope you don't expect me to settle down in the
midst of your things? That would make a fine story&mdash;[<i>staccato</i>]
hm!&mdash;especially when I&mdash;think of what happened&mdash;once upon a
time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What was that? Are you referring to what did <i>not</i> happen?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Turning about</i>] You are so silent, Alice? What is the
matter, old girl? Not blue, I hope?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I sit here and think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Goodness! Are you thinking? But you have to think
quickly, keenly, and correctly, if it is to be of any help! So
do your thinking now&mdash;one, two, three! Ha-ha! You can't! Well,
then, I must try&mdash;Where is Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Where is Allan? [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>remains silent</i>] Where is the
Lieutenant? [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>as before</i>] I say, Curt&mdash;what are you going
to do with Allan now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do with him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, you cannot afford to keep him in the artillery now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Perhaps not.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You had better get him into some cheap infantry
regiment&mdash;up in Norrland, or somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. In Norrland?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, or suppose you turned him into something practical
at once? If I were in your place, I should get him into
some business office&mdash;why not? [<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>is silent</i>] In these
enlightened times&mdash;yah! Alice is so <i>uncommonly</i> silent! Yes,
children, this is the seesawing seesaw board of life&mdash;one moment
high up, looking boldly around, and the next way down, and then
upward again, and so on&mdash;So much for that&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>] Did you
say anything? [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>shakes her head</i>] We may expect company
here in a few days.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Were you speaking to me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. We may expect company in a few days&mdash;notable company!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Who?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Behold&mdash;you're interested! Now you can sit there and
guess who is coming, and between guesses you may read this
letter over again. [<i>Hands her an opened letter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. My letter? Opened? Back from the mail?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Yes, as the head of the family and your
guardian, I look after the sacred interests of the family, and
with iron hand I shall cut short every effort to break the
family ties by means of criminal correspondence. Yah! [<span class="small-c">ALICE</span>
<i>is crushed</i>] I am not dead, you know, but don't take offence
now because I am going to raise us all out of undeserved
humility&mdash;undeserved on my own part, at least!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Judith! Judith!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And Holofernes? I, perhaps? Pooh!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Goes out through the background</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Who is that man?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. How can I tell?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. We are beaten.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes&mdash;beyond a doubt.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He has stripped me of everything, but so cleverly that I
can accuse him of nothing.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Why, no&mdash;you owe him a debt of gratitude instead!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Does he know what he is doing?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, I don't think so. He follows his nature and his
instincts, and just now he seems to be in favour where fortune
and misfortune are being meted out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I suppose it's the Colonel who is to come here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Probably. And that is why Allan must go.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And you find that right?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then our ways part.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Ready to go</i>] A little&mdash;but we shall come together
again.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Probably.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And do you know where?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You guess it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. That's easy! He takes the house and buys the furniture.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I think so, too. But don't desert me!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not for a little thing like that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Good-bye. [<i>Goes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Good-bye.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Same stage setting, but the day is cloudy and it is
raining outside</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>and</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>enter from the background, wearing
rain coats and carrying umbrellas</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. At last I have got you to come here! But, I cannot be so
cruel as to wish you welcome to your own home&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, why not? I have passed through three forced sales&mdash;and
worse than that&mdash;It doesn't matter to me.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Did he call you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It was a formal command, but on what basis I don't
understand.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Why, he is not your superior!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, but he has made himself king of the island. And if
there be any resistance, he has only to mention the Colonel's
name, and everybody submits. Tell me, is it to-day the Colonel
is coming?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He is expected&mdash;but I know nothing with certainty&mdash;Sit
down, please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Sitting down</i>] Nothing has been changed here.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Don't think of it! Don't renew the pain!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. The pain? I find it merely a little strange. Strange as
the man himself. Do you know, when I made his acquaintance as
a boy, I fled him. But he was after me. Flattered, offered
services, and surrounded me with ties&mdash;I repeated my attempt at
escape, but in vain&mdash;And now I am his slave!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And why? He owes you a debt, but you appear as the debtor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Since I lost all I had, he has offered me help in getting
Allan through his examinations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. For which you will have to pay dearly! You are still a
candidate for the Riksdag?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, and, so far as I can see, there is nothing in my way.
[<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Is Allan really going to leave to-day?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, if I cannot prevent it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That was a short-lived happiness.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Short-lived as everything but life itself, which lasts all
too long.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Too long, indeed!&mdash;Won't you come in and wait in the
sitting-room? Even if it does not trouble you, it troubles
me&mdash;these surroundings!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. If you wish it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I feel ashamed, so ashamed that I could wish to die&mdash;but
I can alter nothing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Let us go then&mdash;as you wish it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And somebody is coming too.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They go out to the left</i>.</p>

both in uniform and wearing cloaks</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Sit down, my boy, and let me have a talk with you.
[<i>Sits down in the easy-chair</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>sits down on the chair to the left</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It's raining to-day&mdash;otherwise I could sit here
comfortably and look at the sea. [<i>Silence</i>] Well?&mdash;You don't
like to go, do you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I don't like to leave my father.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, your father&mdash;he is rather an unfortunate man.
[<i>Silence</i>] And parents rarely understand the true welfare of
their children. That is to say&mdash;there are exceptions, of course.
Hm! Tell me, Allan, have you any communication with your mother?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes, she writes now and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Do you know that she is your guardian?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Now, Allan, do you know that your mother has authorised
me to act in her place?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I didn't know that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, you know it now. And, therefore, all discussions
concerning your career are done with&mdash;And you are going to
Norrland.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. But I have no money.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I have arranged for what you need.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. All I can do then is to thank you, Uncle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes, <i>you</i> are grateful&mdash;which everybody is not.
Hm!&mdash;[<i>Raising his voice</i>] The Colonel&mdash;do you know the Colonel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Embarrassed</i>] No, I don't.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With emphasis</i>] The Colonel&mdash;is my special
friend&mdash;[<i>a little more hurriedly</i>] as you know, perhaps. Hm!
The Colonel has wished to show his interest in my family,
including my wife's relatives. Through his intercession, the
Colonel has been able to provide the means needed for the
completion of your course. Now you understand the obligation
under which you and your father are placed toward the Colonel.
Have I spoken with sufficient plainness? [<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>bows</i>] Go and
pack your things now. The money will be handed to you at the
landing. And now good-bye, my boy. [<i>Holds out a finger to</i>
<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>] Good-bye then.</p>

you, Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. You don't know me any longer? Where have you been all
this time? What are you looking at? My long dress&mdash;and my
hair&mdash;You have not seen me like this before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. No-o&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Do I look like a married woman?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>turns away from her</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Earnestly</i>] What are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I am saying good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. What? You are going&mdash;away?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I am transferred to Norrland.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Dumfounded</i>] To Norrland? When are you going?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. To-day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Whose doing is this?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Your father's.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. That's what I thought! [<i>Walks up and down the floor,
stamping her feet</i>] I wish you had stayed over to-day.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. In order to meet the Colonel?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. What do you know about the Colonel?&mdash;Is it certain that
you are going?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. There is no other choice. And now I want it myself.
[<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Why do you want it now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I want to get away from here&mdash;out into the world!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. It's too close here? Yes, Allan, I understand you&mdash;it's
unbearable here&mdash;here, where they speculate&mdash;in soda and human
beings! [Silence.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>With genuine emotion</i>] As you know, Allan, I possess
that fortunate nature which cannot suffer&mdash;but&mdash;now I am
learning!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Yes&mdash;now it's beginning! [<i>She presses both hands to her
breast</i>] Oh, how it hurts&mdash;oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I don't know&mdash;I choke&mdash;I think I'm going to die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Crying out</i>] Oh! Is this the way it feels? Is this the
way&mdash;poor boys!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I should smile, if I were as cruel as you are.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I am not cruel, but I didn't know better&mdash;You must not
go!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. I have to!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Go then&mdash;but give me a keepsake!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. What have I to give you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>With all the seriousness of deepest suffering</i>]
You!&mdash;No, I can never live through this! [<i>Cries out, pressing
her breast with both hands</i>] I suffer, I suffer&mdash;What have
you done to me? I don't want to live any longer! Allan, don't
go&mdash;not alone! Let us go together&mdash;we'll take the small
boat, the little white one&mdash;and we'll sail far out, with the
main sheet made fast&mdash;the wind is high&mdash;and we sail till we
founder out there, way out, where there is no eelgrass and no
jelly-fish&mdash;What do you say?&mdash;But we should have washed the
sails yesterday&mdash;they should be white as snow&mdash;for I want to see
white in that moment&mdash;and you swim with your arm about me until
you grow tired&mdash;and then we sink&mdash;[<i>Turning around</i>] There would
be style in that, a good deal more style than in going about
here lamenting and smuggling letters that will be opened and
jeered at by father&mdash;Allan! [<i>She takes hold of both his arms
and shakes him</i>] Do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Who has been watching her with shining eyes</i>] Judith!
Judith! Why were you not like this before?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I didn't know&mdash;how could I tell what I didn't know?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. And now I must go away from you! But I suppose it is the
better, the only thing! I cannot compete with a man&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Don't speak of the Colonel!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Is it not true?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. It is true&mdash;and it is not true.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Can it become wholly untrue?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Yes, so it shall&mdash;within an hour!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. And you keep your word? I can wait, I can suffer, I can
work&mdash;Judith!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Don't go yet! How long must I wait?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. A year.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Exultantly</i>] One? I shall wait a thousand years,
and if you do not come then, I shall turn the dome of heaven
upside down and make the sun rise in the west&mdash;Hush, somebody
is coming! Allan, we must part&mdash;take me into your arms! [<i>They
embrace each other</i>] But you must not kiss me. [<i>Turns her head
away</i>] There, go now! Go now!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>goes toward the background and puts on his
cloak. Then they rush into each other's arms so
that</i> <span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>disappears beneath the cloak, and for
a moment they exchange kisses</i>. <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>rushes out</i>.
<span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>throws herself face downward on the sofa and
sobs</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. [<i>Comes back and kneels beside the sofa</i>] No, I cannot
go! I cannot go away from you&mdash;not now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] If you could only see how beautiful you are
now! If you could only see yourself!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Oh, no, a man cannot be beautiful. But you, Judith!
You&mdash;that you&mdash;oh, I saw that, when you were kind, another
Judith appeared&mdash;and she's mine!&mdash;But if you don't keep faith
with me now, then I shall die!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I think I am dying even now&mdash;Oh, that I might die now,
just now, when I am so happy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. Somebody is coming!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Let them come! I fear nothing in the world hereafter.
But I wish you could take me along under your cloak. [<i>She
hides herself in play under his cloak</i>] And then I should fly
with you to Norrland. What are we to do in Norrland? Become a
Fusilier&mdash;one of those that wear plumes on their hats? There's
style in that, and it will be becoming to you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Plays with his hair.</i></p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span> <i>kisses the tips of her fingers, one by
one&mdash;and then he kisses her shoe</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. What are you doing, Mr. Madcap? Your lips will get
black. [<i>Rising impetuously</i>] And then I cannot kiss you when
you go! Come, and I'll go with you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. No, then I should be placed under arrest.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I'll go with you to the guard-room.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. They wouldn't let you! We must part now!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. I am going to swim after the steamer&mdash;and then you jump
in and save me&mdash;and it gets into the newspapers, and we become
engaged. Shall we do that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>. You can still jest?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. There will always be time for tears&mdash;Say good-bye
now!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>They rush into each other's arms; then</i> <span class="small-c">ALLAN</span>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Enters and goes over to</i> <span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>] What is this?&mdash;Get up

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. So much the better! I want you to compromise me&mdash;but
without any illusions on your part&mdash;Go ahead, please! [<i>They go

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>goes over to the door on the left and opens
it, whereupon she sits down on the sofa</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Enters from the left</i>] You want to speak to me?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Pleasantly, but somewhat condescendingly</i>] Yes, I
have quite a number of important things to tell you. Sit down.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Sits down on the chair to the left</i>] I am all ears.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well, then!&mdash;[<i>Bumptiously</i>] You know that our
quarantine system has been neglected during nearly a century&mdash;hm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] That's the candidate for the Riksdag who
speaks now.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. But with the tremendous development witnessed by our
own day in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] The communications, of course!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>.&mdash;all kinds of ways the government has begun to
consider improvements. And for this purpose the Board of Health
has appointed inspectors&mdash;hm!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] He's giving dictation.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You may as well learn it now as later&mdash;I have been
appointed an inspector of quarantines. [<i>Silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I congratulate&mdash;and pay my respects to my superior at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. On account of ties of kinship our personal relations
will remain unchanged. However&mdash;to speak of other things&mdash;At
my request your son Allan has been transferred to an infantry
regiment in Norrland.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. But I don't want it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Your will in this case is subordinate to the mother's
wishes&mdash;and as the mother has authorised me to decide, I have
formed this decision.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I admire you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Is that the only feeling you experience at this moment
when you are to part from your son? Have you no other purely
human feelings?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. You mean that I ought to be suffering?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. It would please you if I suffered. You wish me to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. <i>You</i> suffer?&mdash;Once I was taken sick&mdash;you were present
and I can still remember that your face expressed nothing but
undisguised pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. That is not true! Curt sat beside your bed all night
and calmed you down when your qualms of conscience became too
violent&mdash;but when you recovered you ceased to be thankful for
it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Pretending not to hear</i> Alice] Consequently Allan
will have to leave us.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And who is going to pay for it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I have done so already&mdash;that is to say, we&mdash;a syndicate
of people interested in the young man's future.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. A syndicate?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Yes&mdash;and to make sure that everything is all right you
can look over these subscription lists.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Hands him some papers</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Lists? [<i>Reading the papers</i>] These are begging letters?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Call them what you please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Have you gone begging on behalf of my son?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Are you ungrateful again? An ungrateful man is the
heaviest burden borne by the earth.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Then I am dead socially! And my candidacy is done for!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. What candidacy?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. For the Riksdag, of course.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. I hope you never had any such notions&mdash;particularly as
you might have guessed that I, as an older resident, intended to
offer my own services, which you seem to underestimate.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh, well, then that's gone, too!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. It doesn't seem to trouble you very much.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Now you have taken everything&mdash;do you want more?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Have you anything more? And have you anything to
reproach me with? Consider carefully if you have anything to
reproach me with.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Strictly speaking, no! Everything has been correct and
legal as it should be between honest citizens in the course of
daily life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You say this with a resignation which I would call
cynical. But your entire nature has a cynical bent, my dear
Curt, and there are moments when I feel tempted to share
Alice's opinion of you&mdash;that you are a hypocrite, a hypocrite of
the first water.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Calmly</i>] So that's Alice's opinion?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] It was&mdash;once. But not now, for it takes true
heroism to bear what you have borne&mdash;or it takes something else!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Now I think the discussion may be regarded as closed.
You, Curt, had better go and say good-bye to Allan, who is
leaving with the next boat.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] So soon? Well, I have gone through worse things
than that.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You say that so often that I am beginning to wonder
what you went through in America?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. What I went through? I went through misfortunes. And it is
the unmistakable right of every human being to suffer misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Sharply</i>] There are self-inflicted misfortunes&mdash;were
yours of that kind?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is not this a question of conscience?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Brusquely</i>] Do you mean to say you have a conscience?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. There are wolves and there are sheep, and no human being
is honoured by being a sheep. But I'd rather be that than a wolf!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. You don't recognise the old truth, that everybody is
the maker of his own fortune?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Is <i>that</i> a truth?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And you don't know that a man's own strength&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes, I know that from the night when your own strength
failed you, and you lay flat on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Raising his voice</i>] A deserving man like myself
&mdash;yes, look at me&mdash;For fifty years I have fought&mdash;against
a world&mdash;but at last I have won the game, by perseverance,
loyalty, energy, and&mdash;integrity!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. You should leave that to be said by others!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. The others won't say it because they are jealous.
However&mdash;we are expecting company&mdash;my daughter Judith will
to-day meet her intended&mdash;Where is Judith?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. She is out.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. In the rain? Send for her.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Perhaps I may go now?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. No, you had better stay. Is Judith dressed&mdash;Properly?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, so-so&mdash;Have you definite word from the Colonel that
he is coming?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Rising</i>] Yes&mdash;that is to say, he will take us by
surprise, as it is termed. And I am expecting a telegram from
him&mdash;any moment. [<i>Goes to the right</i>] I'll be back at once.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. There you see him as he is! Can he be called human?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. When you asked that question once before, I answered no.
Now I believe him to be the commonest kind of human being of the
sort that possess the earth. Perhaps we, too, are of the same
kind&mdash;making use of other people and of favourable opportunities?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. He has eaten you and yours alive&mdash;and you defend him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I have suffered worse things. And this man-eater has left
my soul unharmed&mdash;<i>that</i> he couldn't swallow!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What "worse" have you suffered?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And <i>you</i> ask that?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you wish to be rude?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. No, I don't wish to&mdash;and therefore&mdash;don't ask again!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Enters from the right</i>] The telegram was already
there, however&mdash;Please read it, Alice, for I cannot see&mdash;[<i>Seats
himself pompously in the easy-chair</i>] Read it! You need not go,
Curt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>glances through the telegram quickly and looks
perplexed</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Well? Don't you find it pleasing?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="small-c">ALICE</span> <i>stares in silence at the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Ironically</i>] Who is it from?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. From the Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With self-satisfaction</i>] So I thought&mdash;and what does
the Colonel say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. This is what he says: "On account of Miss Judith's
impertinent communication over the telephone, I consider the
relationship ended&mdash;for ever!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Looks intently at the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Once more, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Reads rapidly</i>] "On account of Miss Judith's
impertinent communication over the telephone, I consider the
relationship ended&mdash;for ever!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>Turns pale</i>] It is Judith!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And there is Holofernes!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. And what are you?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Soon you will see!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. This is your doing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>In a rage</i>] This is your doing!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No! [<i>The</i> Captain <i>tries to rise and draw his sabre, but
falls back, touched by an apoplectic stroke</i>] There you got what
was coming to you!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>With senile tears in his voice</i>] Don't be angry at
me&mdash;I am very sick&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Are you? I am glad to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Let us put him to bed.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, I don't want to touch him. [<i>Rings</i>.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. [<i>As before</i>] You must not be angry at me! [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>]
Look after my children!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. This is sublime! I am to look after his children, and he
has stolen mine!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Always the same self-deception!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>. Look after my children! [<i>Continues to mumble
unintelligibly</i>] Blub-blub-blub-blub.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. At last that tongue is checked! Can brag no more, lie no
more, wound no more! You, Curt, who believe in God, give Him
thanks on my behalf. Thank Him for my liberation from the tower,
from the wolf, from the vampire!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Not that way, Alice!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>With her face close to the</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>'s] Where is your
own strength now? Tell me? Where is your energy? [<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">CAPTAIN</span>,
<i>speechless, spits in her face</i>] Oh, you can still squirt venom,
you viper&mdash;then I'll tear the tongue out of your throat! [<i>Cuffs
him on the ear</i>] The head is off, but still it blushes!&mdash;O,
Judith, glorious girl, whom I have carried like vengeance under
my heart&mdash;you, you have set us free, all of us!&mdash;? If you have
more heads than one, Hydra, we'll take them! [<i>Pulls his beard</i>]
Think only that justice exists on the earth! Sometimes I dreamed
it, but I could never believe it. Curt, ask God to pardon me for
misjudging Him. Oh, there is justice! So I will become a sheep,
too! Tell Him that, Curt! A little success makes us better, but
adversity alone turns us into wolves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>enters from the background</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. The Captain has had a stroke&mdash;will you please help us to
roll out the chair?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Well, Miss Judith&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Help us with this first&mdash;then you can speak of Miss
Judith afterward.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>rolls out the chair to the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Away with the carcass! Out with it, and let's open
the doors! The place must be aired! [<i>Opens the doors in the
background; the sky has cleared</i>] Ugh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Are you going to desert him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. A wrecked ship is deserted, and the crew save their
lives&mdash;I'll not act as undertaker to a rotting beast! Drainmen
and dissectors may dispose of him! A garden bed would be too
good for that barrowful of filth! Now I am going to wash and
bathe myself in order to get rid of all this impurity&mdash;if I can
ever cleanse myself completely!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>is seen outside, by the balustrade, waving
her handkerchief toward the sea</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>Toward the background</i>] Who is there? Judith! [<i>Calls
out</i>] Judith!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>.[<i>Cries out as she enters</i>] He is gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Who?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. Allan is gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Without saying good-bye?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. He did to me, and he sent his love to you, Uncle.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Oh, that was it!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. [<i>Throwing herself into</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>'s <i>arms</i>] He is gone!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He will come back, little girl.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Or we will go after him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. [<i>With a gesture indicating the door on the right</i>] And
leave him? What would the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. The world&mdash;bah! Judith, come into my arms! [<span class="small-c">JUDITH</span> <i>goes
up to</i> <span class="small-c">ALICE</span>, <i>who kisses her on the forehead</i>] Do you want to
go after him?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. How can you ask?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. But your father is sick.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. What do I care!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. This is Judith! Oh, I love you, Judith!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. And besides, papa is never mean&mdash;and he doesn't like
cuddling. There's style to papa, after all.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Yes, in a way!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">JUDITH</span>. And I don't think he is longing for me after that
telephone message&mdash;Well, why should he pester me with an old
fellow? No, Allan, Allan! [<i>Throws herself into</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>'s <i>arms</i>]
I want to go to Allan!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Tears herself loose again and runs out to wave her
handkerchief</i></p>

<p>[<span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>follows her and waves his handkerchief also</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Think of it, that flowers can grow out of dirt!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>in from the right</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Yes, Miss Judith&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Is the feeling of those letters that form her name so
sweet on your lips that it makes you forget him who is dying?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Yes, but she said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. She? Say rather Judith then! But first of all&mdash;how goes
it in there?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Oh, in there&mdash;it's all over!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. All over? O, God, on my own behalf and that of all
mankind, I thank Thee for having freed us from this evil!
Your arm, if you please&mdash;I want to go outside and get a
breath&mdash;breathe!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span> <i>offers his arm</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>Checks herself</i>] Did he say anything before the end
came?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Miss Judith's father spoke a few words only.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. He said: "Forgive them, for they know not what they
do!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Inconceivable!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Yes, Miss Judith's father was a good and noble man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Curt!</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span> <i>Enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. It is over!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Do you know what his last words were? No, you can never
guess it. "Forgive them, for they know not what they do!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Can you translate it?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. I suppose he meant that he had always done right and died
as one that had been wronged by life.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. I am sure his funeral sermon will be fine.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And plenty of flowers&mdash;from the non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. About a year ago he said something like this: "It looks
to me as if life were a tremendous hoax played on all of us!"</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Do you mean to imply that he was playing a hoax on us up
to the very moment of death?</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No&mdash;but now, when he is dead, I feel a strange
inclination to speak well of him.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Well, let us do so!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">LIEUTENANT</span>. Miss Judith's father was a good and noble man.</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="small-c">CURT</span>] Listen to that!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. "They know not what they do." How many times did I not ask
you whether he knew what he was doing? And you didn't think he
knew. Therefore, forgive him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. Riddles! Riddles! But do you notice that there is peace
in the house now? The wonderful peace of death. Wonderful as the
solemn anxiety that surrounds the coming of a child into the
world. I hear the silence&mdash;and on the floor I see the traces of
the easy-chair that carried him away&mdash;And I feel that now my own
life is ended, and I am starting on the road to dissolution!
Do you know, it's queer, but those simple words of the
Lieutenant&mdash;and his is a simple mind&mdash;they pursue me, but now
they have become serious. My husband, my youth's beloved&mdash;yes,
perhaps you laugh!&mdash;he <i>was</i> a good and noble man&mdash;nevertheless!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. Nevertheless? And a brave one&mdash;as he fought for his own
and his family's existence!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. What worries! What humiliations! Which he wiped out&mdash;in
order to pass on!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. He was one who had been passed by! And that is to say
much! Alice, go in there!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. No, I cannot do it! For while we have been talking here,
the image of him as he was in his younger years has come back
to me&mdash;I have seen him, I see him&mdash;now, as when he was only
twenty&mdash;I must have loved that man!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">CURT</span>. And hated him!</p>

<p><span class="small-c">ALICE</span>. And hated!&mdash;Peace be with him!</p>
